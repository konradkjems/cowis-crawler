    "text": "on the main interface of ddd pos, as shown in the below screenshot, you can see different information regarding a store. it can tell us if the pos is a riab pos and to which ddd server it is connected. moreover, it also shows us the client id including terminal number for that store and which version of the pos program is currently running on the pos. sometimes, due to internet instability in the store, the pos is not active in communication with ddd api and all data from the pos is not sent to backoffice in that case. it is important to notice all the times, that the pos is in fact communicating with ddd server. an example is shown below where no dddweb with a specific number can be seen. in that case, the solution is to restart the pos programme and it can be done by simply writing restart in the clerk field. after restart, you will observe that the pos is now connected to the ddd webserver again.",
