(can be done in resolved status) as soon as possible after the incident report, a root cause analysis and how we will prevent/mitigate this in future will be sent to all customers who contacted us during the incident. use existing tracker ticket is possible, but if time is exceeded, you may be required to open a new problem record with link to original incident. process diagram major incident handling process.vsdx major incident log the major incident log.xlsx is a list of all major incidents since october 2022. the completed reports can be found in cs global support - support leaders - major incident reports - all documents (sharepoint.com) major incident manager instructions the support major incident manager is accountable for the resolution of any major incidents communication during the incident mim posts to internal stakeholder/senior management teams chat during the incident - chat is named \"retail solutions escalations (group chat for posting urgent customer issues)\" mim sends management updates about the incident to the retail solutions escalations group teams chat every 2 hours (minimum) template for initial notification: summary including affected service/product: ticket number: customers affected: time of discovery: business impact: immediate actions: next update in: mim is a single point of contact (spoc) for escalations and major incidents if the mim is working with an incident, that must take priority over business as usual (bau) tasks until resolved. the mim is responsible for setting up a group chat with involved team/people who are trying to find the cause and resolve the mi. major incident report (story telling after the incident) a major incident report is for internal use (after the incident has been resolved, and within 1 week of it being resolved). the major incident report should be sent to appropriate distribution list, depending on the products and customers affected. you will need to get a root cause from the product owner assuming a software or infrastructure issue was the cause. when you are writing an incident report, you are telling a story. anyone who reads an incident report needs to understand what has happened, when and by which team. use timelines and team names. the template report to take a copy from is ci-000 (ca-xxxxx) major incident report template.docx which is in the folder of all previous major incident reports cs global support - support leaders - major incident reports key contacts for major incident managers in case of major incidents, these are the main contacts you can use to help investigate and resolve incidents (and these people may not be able to help, but should know who can if not) who is on out of hours shifts shifts are managed in a single shift app in ms teams (\"retail solutions customer support\" team). imagine development contacts as per imagine platform issues if other team members required or escalation required, contact matt warr ddd/riab development contacts: ddd backoffice: søren jansen backup: torben christensen ddd pos: rene andersen it-relation - now itm8 itm8 mads røn nielsen, problem manager phone +45 7026 2988 mail servicedesk@itrelation.dk itm8 michael ahrendt-petersen, service delivery manager phone +45 2156 6937 mail: miape@itm8.com see operating status - driftsinformation | itm8 mstore backoffice - paul marquick or alex armstrong for web dave radford (product owner) for anything else/if you can't contact the above, or if you need help with the developers matt warr manages all retail solutions development teams, so he is the single point of development escalation node4 node4 sre - tom grantham node 4 incident management node4 service desk (0800 054 1220)",
