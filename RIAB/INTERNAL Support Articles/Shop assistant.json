    "text": "if the shop assistants can't log in (they type in their number and nothing happens), the pos program needs to be restarted through task manager. 1. in teamviewer, under actions, choose the send ctrl-alt-delete 2. choose task manager 3. choose the pos program and click end task 4. scroll down to any ddd instances, choose them and click end task 5. scroll further down and check if there are any other backgroundprocesse s open called anything with pos in them and shut them down too (there's usually ony 1). 6. close the task manager and restart the pos program. now they should be able to log in. an alternative, that the customer can perform themselves, is to shut down the pc, leave it off for about 30 seconds, and then turn it back on. that works too.",
