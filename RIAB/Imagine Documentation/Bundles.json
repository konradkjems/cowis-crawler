    "text": "table of contents modifier groups modifier groups list create a modifier group number picker example. modifier groups modifier groups enable you to apply certain prescribed modifications to an item. note that you can only modify an item or a bundle main item, but not a bundle group item. you would use a modifier group if you wish to add one or more variable modifiers to a particular item. modifiers can have additional prices added on top of the item price. for instance, suppose you order a cup of coffee. you choose a latte but would also like to select your preferred type of milk, an extra shot of espresso, and a flavour of syrup. this would require three modifier groups: \"milk\": this modifier group lists the milk options available, such as semi skimmed, skimmed, whole, oat, soy, and almond. \"shots\": this modifier group includes the optional extra shots available. \"syrups\": this modifier group provides the syrup choices. please note that modifiers are not currently linked to items within imagine and do not affect the stock. modifiers appear in the front-end apps, similar to the example shown below: modifier groups list a modifier group list displays all the existing modifier groups that you have currently set up. from this list, you can create new modifier groups or select an existing one to view or edit its details. note that you cannot delete modifier groups, as they may be linked to other groups for which sales have already been registered. create a modifier group to begin creating modifiers use the this will then open up to the page below. number picker uses a +/- button to increase and decrease selection amounts. can be used for items like \"extra shot\". checkbox buttons uses tick boxes for selections. can be used for items like a sandwich with different fillings like lettuce, tomatoes or onion. name the name is used internally. display name the name is seen by front-end users. number picker example. you can add/edit as many different number pickers into your modifier group as required within the table. to add more modifiers use the to add a new line. image enter a url for an image to be shown against the modifier in the front-end apps. only .bmp, .gif, .jpg and .svg type images are supported. name the name of the modifier as it appears in the front-end apps. itemno used for integration purposes, you can link a modifier to an existing imagine item which can then be related to a third-party erp system item. default value the number you get by default upon selection. min the minimum value you can enter for the modifier. max the maximum number allowed to be entered for the modifier. sales price optional sales prices for modifiers that get added to the price from the default value. as an example, suppose you have set a default value of 1 for shots, and each additional shot costs £1.10. in this case, the price for each shot added will be added to the item price. however, if the default value is 1, but you have set the minimum value to 0, then the price will not be subtracted if the default shot is removed. this means that the customer cannot lower the base price of the item by removing the modifiers. ensure you save the individual rows before trying to add a new row or save the group. it will only save changes which have been individually saved in that table. example coffee price: £3.00 shot price: £1.00 default shots: 2 minimum shots: 1 number of shots coffee total price reason 1 £3.00 the base price is £3.00 and they have removed 1 shot, but you do not have the cost of the shot removed for your default shots. 2 £3.00 the default number of shots, therefore default coffee price applies. 3 £4.00 2 default shots are included in the price, and 1 additional shot for £1. 4 £5.00 2 default shots included in the price, s additional shots for £2. checkbox button example. checkbox buttons are a type of modifier that allows you to provide one or more selectable options to customers, both as optional or mandatory selections. they are called checkbox buttons because they appear as clickable buttons that resemble checkboxes, which can be easily selected with a touch screen. these are particularly useful for providing choices of fillings for sandwiches or toppings for pizzas, for example. customers can select one or more options or none of them, depending on their preferences. name this should be the name used internally. display name this should be the name seen by front-end users. min the minimum value you can enter for the modifier. max the maximum number allowed to be entered for the modifier checkbox buttons are a way to offer optional or mandatory selections to customers, where they can choose one or more options from a list. if the modifier is not mandatory, the minimum value should always be 0, while if you want to ensure that at least one modifier is always selected, set the minimum to 1. the maximum value is typically set to 1, to limit the number of selections to one per group. however, for optional toppings, you may choose to set a higher limit. to create or modify modifiers, use the table below. you can add, delete, or modify rows as needed. remember to save each row before attempting to add a new one or save the group, as changes are only saved for rows that have been individually saved within the table. image enter an image url this will be shown against the modifier at the front end. note: only .bmp / .gif / .jpg /.svg image types are supported. name the name of the modifier as it appears in the front-end apps. itemno used for integration purposes, you can link a modifier to an existing imagine item which can then be related to a third-party erp system item. default value - if the button is selected by default. for example, in a latte case, you might have semi skimmed selected by default. sales price optional sales prices for modifiers that get added to the price of the default value. when you select a syrup for your coffee, an additional charge of £0.50 will be added to the item price. however, if the syrup is set as a default selection, the charge for it will not be subtracted from the item price. you can also set higher prices for more premium modifiers to increase revenue. keep in mind that any additional charges for modifiers will be added to the item price, so the final price of the item may vary based on the selections made.",
