    "text": "custom variable to print the value of a custom attribute for an item, you can use the custom attribute variable. as an item can have multiple attributes, it is necessary to specify which attribute value to print using the variable. the custom attribute variable requires a single argument, which is the that defines the custom attribute id to use. on the printed label, the data in the value field of the specified custom attribute for that item will be printed. custom variables are structured as {customattribute|} to use this variable, you need to replace with the actual id of the custom attribute you want to print. the pipe character (|) must be used to separate the variable name from the argument. you can find the ids of all custom attributes listed on the custom attribute overview page under item - custom attributes. the variable will then print the value of the specified custom attribute for the item on the label. to insert the correct custom attribute variable on the label template, simply place the cursor where you want the variable and select it from the custom attribute list. the variable and argument will be inserted for you. dimension variable the dimension variable prints the value of dimensions for an item. you need to specify which dimension value to print since an item can have multiple dimensions. to determine the range of dimensions for an item, check the matrix tab for that item. the dimension view also displays the values applied to an item. the dimension variable requires a single argument , which indicates the dimension sequence id to use. you can find dimension sequences in the dimension view of the matrix tab for the item. the id of the far left-hand dimension sequence is 1, and the id of the far right-hand column is 10. select the current dimension sequence for the argument. dimension variables are structured as {dimension|} to use the dimension variable, replace the argument with the value of the dimension sequence id to print. the resulting label will show the value given for the item at the associated dimension sequence id. the pipe character (|) should be used to delimit the variable name from the argument. sales price variable the sales price variable allows you to display the value of an item in different currencies on the label. to specify which currency to print, you need to use the argument. this argument must be iso 4217 compliant and can only be one of the currencies listed in the matrix tab for the item. the available currencies are part of the value selectors and are labeled as \"sales price.\" the variable is structured as: {salesprice|} to create the label, replace the argument with the 3-letter currency code of the currency you want to print. the label will display the value of the item in the corresponding currency field shown in the matrix tab. be sure to use the pipe character (|) to separate the variable name from the argument.",
