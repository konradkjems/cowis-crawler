    "text": "What to do if you investigate a Tray issue and get to the point where you think the work might be chargeable? If that happens, pass the details onto the Customer Success Manager as per Passing Sales Opportunities to CSMs In essence, if the customer can prove, or we think that an issue is caused by a fault in Tray (not config/how it's been used) or a fault in our cloud platform, then it's included/supported. If not, then the work should probably be chargeable. It's not always that simple, so more guidance below… What Is Supported If a customer has a subscription to use Data Switch and something does not work as expected, what will K3 investigate and help with as included in the subscription fees is listed below: Platform availability issues - note the Status Page once signed in: K3 Dataswitch Status Processing faults which are not thought to be due to data or configuration User Interface not working as expected/as per documentation Limited How-To - point people to the manual for how to do things (we don't provide training free of charge) What is not Supported (and what options are there for the customer) We may investigate something which looks like it's an issue which we do support, but as soon as we conclude that the work should be chargeable, then the customer must be informed, an effort estimate made, and the Opportunity passed to the CSM If we need Solution Delivery to investigate the issue to help determine the cause/solution, their time spent investigating will normally be chargeable (i.e. ad-hoc consulting) The ultimate aim should be to have the customer subscribe to an annual contract with us to maintain knowledge of their DSw configuration and help them out with items which are not supported under the product subscription. This is better for K3 than unpredictable one-off consulting requests, and better for the customer because they have an SLA with us for investigating and fixing these items (no SLA for change requests, but we do have a commitment to have the resource and knowledge available for them). What work we should notdo as part of their annual subscription to use Data Switch (unless they have a specific extra Order/SoW/contract for this) is below: Configuration changes e.g. for business logic changes or if a third party API changes Faults caused by invalid data (i.e. upstream or downstream systems) Faults caused by the customer changing the configuration Note that DataSwitch on-premise is supported by NexSys (was SysPro) i.e. they take 1st line and also maintain the code",
