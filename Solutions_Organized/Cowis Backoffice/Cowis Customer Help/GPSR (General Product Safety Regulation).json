    "text": "Dear customers, the new General Product Safety Regulation (GPSR) of the European Union will come into force on December 13, 2024. This regulation will significantly tighten the product safety requirements for all non-food products sold on the EU market. As a provider of a merchandise management system, we would like to draw your attention to the upcoming changes and help you to be prepared in good time. What does the GPSR mean for retailers and manufacturers? Product safety obligations: Products must meet the new requirements of the GPSR before they can be sold. Extended information obligations: Warnings and safety information must be available in the respective national languages of the EU member states. Traceable supply chains: The traceability of products must be guaranteed in order to be able to react quickly to safety problems. Sanctions for violations: Companies that do not meet the requirements must expect stricter controls and potential penalties. How COWIS can support you With COWIS you can efficiently ensure compliance with the new regulations: Product data management: Centrally manage all safety-relevant information and documentation. Our tip for you: If you are a COWIS DdD eShop customer, you have the option of storing all manufacturer-relevant information in the shop in the form of a CSV file. If necessary, please contact Mr. Maretzke directly at markus.maretzke@k3btg.com. He will support you with this. (This service may be subject to a fee and is calculated depending on the effort involved). Multilingual integration: Store the required warnings and safety information for all EU languages in your system. Our tip for you: Actively use CHAT GPT to quickly and easily translate the manufacturer-relevant information into all necessary languages. Traceability: Make sure that the supply chain of your products is fully documented in order to meet legal requirements. Act in good time! The GPSR brings with it numerous changes that require careful preparation. We would be happy to help you adapt your processes accordingly and be optimally prepared for the new regulations. We are available at any time for further information or individual advice. Best regards, Your DdD COWIS team",

This is how you read an update into Cowis Since the GPSR requires the specification of a manufacturer for articles, and the supplier is not always the manufacturer, we had to create a new feature in the addresses area.

You will first notice this in the list layer of addresses. If you create a new manufacturer address, you can define whether this is a pure manufacturer address by activating the manufacturer checkbox. The following applies to pure manufacturer addresses: Please ask your specialist lawyer or use the Internet search functions to find out what requirements the GPSR has for manufacturer addresses. (We cannot give you legally binding information on this.

(However, there will be no check to see whether you have marked customer, employee or supplier addresses, you must be careful here) If you have only maintained your supplier addresses rudimentarily in the past, it is high time to complete all the missing information so that the address also meets the GPSR requirements.
