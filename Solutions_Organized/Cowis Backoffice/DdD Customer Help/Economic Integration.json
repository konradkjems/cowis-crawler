To be able to make the setup we need to go through the following steps: AgreementGrantToken To enable us to send data to Economic, we ask you to follow the link and return the resulting code to us: https://secure.e-conomic.com/secure/api1/requestaccess.aspx?appPublicToken=bTdCvYFj4PtI8GMehfbrRWMeZLDlvpMluaTWb86z85U1 2. Accounts Together with this letter you should have received an Excel document in which you are supposed to write account numbers and possibly counter account numbers for the payment types and item groups that are used in the shop. A counter account is typically used for costs, money from POS to bank, and cost of goods sold. If you want a specific setup for each shop and/or range of POS’es you can just create new tabs in the Excel document, each containing a copy of the “template”, and fill in account numbers. The Excel document should be returned to us. 3. Test When the setup has been made we will send data for a given period to Economic. The purpose of this is to correct errors and misunderstandings. 4. Auto When testing is finished we will start the automated generation of data. This means that every night you should get data from the past day. Resending of data for a given period of time is always possible. However, we will have to send data for whole days and for at least one shop in the setup. This meaans that it is not possible to send data for a single POS or a payment type/item group that had been missed in the original setup. We expect the following returned from you: Name of draft in Economic (We will send data to the draft): AgreementGrantToken (text string, rather not a picture): The filled in Excel document/documents",
