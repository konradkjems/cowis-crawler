Typically, your K3 representative will handle the setup of these extensions if needed. The Expansion Framework enables the integration of external extensions hosted outside of the Imagine platform, providing additional functionality beyond what is currently offered by Imagine. It is primarily available for Self Serve and Simple POS applications. Typical Uses: One example of using the Expansion framework is during a transaction before payment is made. At this point, a unique identifier is sent to the third-party API, identifying the session and the basket. Imagine will open a window for the external services to interact with the user and await a completion message. The third-party application can perform custom actions, such as collecting additional information from the user or directly interacting with the Imagine basket object. Expansions offer the ability to incorporate additional functions that may not be relevant or accessible to the retailer directly. For instance, there might be a shop feature that requires K3 to set up and configure, but the retailer needs the capability to enable or disable the feature independently. Clean Cash: If Clean Cash is enabled for the tenant and shop, you can enable or disable it within the Expansion framework. Please refer to the Clean Cash notes for information on when it can be temporarily disabled.",
