    "title": "Step 2 Fixed Selection Fields",
    "text": "Within the Excel Template file, certain fields are populated with drop-down selections based on the information stored in Imagine. Additionally, some fields will only appear if they are enabled and set as required in Imagine. It is crucial to carefully review the items to be imported and ensure that the necessary information is set up in Imagine beforehand. Manual addition of these values to the spreadsheet is not possible. Here are some specific details regarding the fields: Vendors - These need to be set up in Imagine to appear in the drop-down list within the template. Hierarchy Nodes (Departments/Categories) - These also need to be set up in Imagine for them to appear in the drop-down list within the template. Tax Rates - Each Tax Group will be displayed as a separate field and present a list of available tax codes in their respective drop-down lists. For example, a UK Tax Group may show options like 20% and 0%, a French Tax Group may display 23% and 5%, and an Irish Tax Group may show 23%, 15%, and 0%. Dimension Types - This column refers solely to the type of dimension, such as Color, Size, or Fit-Width. Each dimension type will have its column at the end of the import template. Please note that this should not be confused with Dimension Templates. Custom Attributes - Only Custom Attributes marked as required will be shown in the template for input. Prices - The Selling Price for each currency will be included as an available field, based on the currencies set up against a particular Shop. Take care to ensure that the necessary data is properly set up in Imagine before using the import template, as this will ensure accurate and comprehensive information can be imported. The tabs at the bottom of the template contain the data used by the drop-down menus. These cannot be edited but are useful to see what is available from each of the drop-down selections.",

The template spreadsheet can be used for items with and without dimensions [Colours/sizes] and can contain a mixture of both. Field Information An item with No Dimensions - All information about the item will be entered on one line. When updating an Item with No Dimensions the Master Item information shown on the Summary tab will be matched up to the Item information as shown on the Matrix tab. An item with Dimensions - There will be multiple lines for this item, each line representing the colour/size combination. The Master Item Number must be the same for all lines for the item to be created properly with all the colours/sizes required. Requirements The Master Item Number (MIN) must be the same for each dimension variation of the item (e.g., Colour, Size, Fit). SKT01 in the example covers all dimensions of the Skye Tee Shirt. Item Number (IN) and Barcode (BC) must be unique for each dimension variation. If an item does not have a manufacturer's barcode, you must add one to the item. This could be the same as the Item Number [IN] field or your own internally generated number. E.g. 200001 or 201000345. If using a number structure please ensure you are consistent, and the number is unique. Contact your K3 project consultant for further advice if required. Dimension Details must be a unique combination covering all dimensions used for example if an item has 2 Dimensions, you cannot have Blue and Small together for more than 1 dimension variation. The Vendor must be the same for all dimension variations as per the Item [Master Item Number]. For all other fields, it is possible to make changes per dimension variation, but beware of how it may appear in Imagine, per dimension variation.",

Submit the Sheet to start the first part of the import process. Use the browse for Excel Spread Sheet to find the sheet to import, then click submit sheet. The status “Processing” means the file is being checked, and then it moves to ‘validating’. If successful it will move to a status of ‘Validated’ with an Edit Pencil and Tick icon showing in the Actions column. If there is a problem, it will move to an ‘Invalid’ Status. [See Invalid Status section on what to do next] If there is no activity after a short period, use the Refresh List button to refresh the page. Processing and Validation time will vary based on the number of items and lines being imported. [Optional] Review of Validated items. When the status shows validated, the Edit Pencil can be used to review any of the items before completing the Import process. Items can be changed using the Edit pencil of each line, or if required items deleted using the recycle bin of each line. You must choose the ‘Validate’ button again if any changes are made, otherwise use the X to close the page, ready to ‘Complete the Import’. [If required] Validation Errors - Invalid Status. Invalid status means there is something not quite right with the data in the spreadsheet. Typically, it is missing information, or duplicated information such as the item number, a barcode or dimension variations. Some corrections can be made at this validation stage without re-importing the spreadsheet, others may require a spreadsheet change followed by another import. In the Actions column, click on the Edit Pencil to see exactly what the problem is and apply the correction. The items shown in RED are the items that require attention. Click on the down arrow at the start of each line to see the Validation Error message. [There may be more than 1 validation message per line] In this example, the Manufacturer Items Number is missing. Option 1: Update the spreadsheet and re-import again. Option 2: Click on the Edit Pencil between the arrow and the recycle bin to add the missing information. Use the SAVE icon between the down arrow and recycle bin to save your changes for this line. Repeat option 2 for all other lines showing in Red. Once all corrections are made, choose VALIDATE to re-validate the data. The status will show Validating then move to ‘Validated’ with an Edit Pencil and Tick icon showing in the Actions column if successful. If there is still a problem, it will move back to an ‘Invalid’ Status. If there is no activity after a short period, use the Refresh List button to refresh the page. Processing and Validation time will vary based on the number of items and lines being imported. Continue with the next step to ‘Complete the Import’. Export Validation Errors In the event there are a lot of errors, use the ‘Export All Data’ option to export to a spreadsheet for easier identification. The spreadsheet will be downloaded to the download folder or your specified download location.",
