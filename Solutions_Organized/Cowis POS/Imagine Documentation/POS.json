    "text": "The Imagine PoS system is a Point of Sale (PoS) solution that operates directly within modern HTML5-compatible browsers. It is specifically designed to function seamlessly both online and offline, leveraging the advanced capabilities of contemporary browsers and a distinctive hardware platform. This eliminates any worries a retailer may have about potential connection issues. While the system provides a reliable offline functionality, retailers should consider investing in a dependable LAN (local area network) and Wi-Fi infrastructure, which may include backup connections such as mobile network cut-over, if there is a desire to maintain an uninterrupted and continuously accessible service. The Point of Sale system operates on a supported browser and device, requiring an Internet connection. This connection can be established through either Wi-Fi or a wired LAN connection. However, if you are using a fixed PoS system rather than a mobile device, it is recommended to utilize a wired connection for enhanced stability. The PoS system interacts with a web-based database in real-time, allowing it to read and write data seamlessly. Coupled with the database, all business logic acting on this data is also held and processed in cloud based computing. To mitigate outages the PoS system has incorporated an offline failover function, enabling you to continue trading even in the absence of an Internet connection. To facilitate the connection between the hardware components (such as PoS printer, cash drawer, PIN entry device) and the system, a device called a \"Connector\" is employed. The Connector must always remain connected to the local network via a wired connection. Online mode requires the Connector to be connected to the Internet too. In the event of offline working, where the shop has no access to the Internet, then the browser and Connector work in tandem on the LAN to allow continuous transactions recording and printing. Offline working is jointly handed by features of the browser and Connector and is reliant on the LAN being active. The configuration of the Connector is managed through the POS Admin, which operates within the Imagine Portal. When initially running the device, the Connector needs to be online to establish a connection with the server and download its configuration and offline data. However, once this initial setup is completed, the Connector can operate either online or offline. It is strongly recommended that the Connector is keep online where possible as offline data can become out of date where item details are altered in Inventory. It is important to note that if there is no local connection between the browser device and the Connector (due to a router or local network being down), you will be unable to communicate with the hardware or conduct offline transactions. This also applies to PIN Entry Devices (PED's) that must be on the local connection in order to function.",

Browsers can be configured to automatically clear these on browser exit, and other third-party applications can also \"clean\" your browser These types of tasks should not be performed. ⚠CAUTION: If you clear the local storage (Through clearing browser cache, running clean-up tools, deleting cookies etc) whilst you are offline, then you will not be able to start the POS. You may however be asked to clear the cache by a member of the K3 support team. NOTE: Any sales completed using the 'default' connector will not show on the Z read. The 'default' connector is available whilst offline to enable sales to be completed. NOTE: The POS can go into offline mode if there is an issue with the K3 Servers, this can happen even if the POS is still connected to the internet. If you suspect this is an issue you can check status.k3imagine.com Some transaction data will be stored on the connector and will remain even if the connector is rebooted. The Connector will continuously try and send receipts to imagine every 60mins, once back online it will take up to a minute for these to sync. Offline whilst the POS screen is open.

    "text": "The first you time access the POS you must the portal via http://portal.k3imagine.com NOTE: You must also do the same if you have cleared your local storage. Once you have access to the POS via the portal, you can then save http://pos.k3imagine.com as a bookmark or set it as a home page within your browser settings. The top bar lets you access a few different functions. Allows you to set the default connector that this POS uses. Toggles full-screen mode (on supported browsers) Alerts you of any notifications or messages from the head office. Allows you to access other functions and brings up a side menu. The only option on the home page is Portal Logout. The second section shows some basic statistics from the last transaction. The sales value and the change issued. This can be disabled in the Admin module. In the middle section, the date and the POS number that is assigned to this device are displayed.

This is because the POS is fully portable and not device-specific. When the POS number reaches 99, it will look for the lowest unused POS number. It also displays the login box.

    "text": "TABLE OF CONTENTS Scanning a barcode Searching for an item Browsing and searching for an item Matrix Lookup Scanning a barcode You can manually scan an item with the physical barcode using the scanner and it will appear on the POS. You can also manually input the barcode using either an external keyboard or the Soft Keyboard, Click the enter barcode section This will bring up the soft keyboard. Enter the barcode and press enter key on the keyboard or the green tick on the soft keyboard. The item will be displayed on the POS Searching an item The Enter Barcode box allows you to scan a product barcode, or search for an item to add to the transaction if you know its barcode. You can also directly enter a receipts barcode here, or the Matrix code for a range of variant items (see Matrix Lookup below) The POS will automatically detect input from an external source, such as a keyboard or a barcode scanner. However, if you want to use the soft keyboard, tap the Enter barcode box and you will be able to tap a barcode number. Browsing and searching for an item Click the browse button to perform a search. This will take you to a list of products where you can directly scroll through the items and select using the Cart button. NOTE: This list will only show active items, however, inactive items can still be scanned and added to the transaction. Items can be made active in the Matrix Tab. Cancel will return you to the Transaction screen. Reset will reset your search parameters. Use Filter to narrow down your search to a particular word(s) More will take you to the next page of results. The Filter button shows a panel where you can search for active items. When you tap the search box the soft keyboard will appear. Enter a description and it will perform a smart search, looking for the values you type. It will separate words by a blank space and search for combinations of these words. When you have found the item and you want to add it to the transaction, you press the Cart button If you want to print an item details label instead of adding it to the transaction, press the Print button This will open the left side tray where you can enter the quantity of labels required and choose which label design to print. Matrix Lookup When an item has multiple variations i.e. Colour or size you can use the Matrix Look Up. Input the Matrix Number into the barcode section on the POS. In the example below the Matrix Number is 000301 Press enter and this will bring up a list of available Variations of this item. Make the selections on the screen by tapping the options. NOTE: To deselect an option tap it again. NOTE: You cannot select multiple options of one variation i.e. you cannot have two colours selected at the same time. In the example below the selection is Colour-Pink and Size-M. Once you have made the selection tap OK to confirm and you will return to the transaction screen and the item line will be listed. NOTE: Tapping Cancel will return you to the transaction screen. You can now finalise the transaction.",

    "title": "Gift Aid",
    "text": "TABLE OF CONTENTS Introduction Receipts Settings Selecting Gift Aid Items POS Customer Capture Transactions Introduction Gift Aid is a UK scheme from HMRC where eligible organisations such as charities can accept donations instead of payments and claim the equivalent of the donator's income tax relief. This works by capturing a customer’s details at the POS when they wish to purchase a qualifying item. This data is then exported and submitted to HMRC to claim tax relief for the donation. How it works When an item marked with a Gift Aid attribute is sold via the POS, a prompt is displayed to confirm if the customer would like to give Gift Aid to the organisation. If Yes is chosen then the required customer detail is captured and the value of the transaction will be recorded for HMRC. On a periodic schedule, these transactions are exported to a spreadsheet and submitted to HMRC, usually via a dedicated portal for Gift Aid. Your accountant will be able to further advise on the submission process. For full details of Gift Aid rules see HMRC Gift Aid Receipts Editing Customer Declaration for Gift Aid The customer declaration is printed on the POS during a Gift Aid transaction. The wording of the declaration can be edited in Gift Aid - Receipts. Click Save when editing is complete. Settings Creating a Custom Attribute for Gift Aid To identify items for Gift Aid a Customer Attribute is needed. In Inventory - Customer Attributes create a new custom attribute. The custom attribute should be created as type Yes / No, it should be left as optional. Give the Custom Attribute a code and name that identifies it as a Gift Aid custom attribute. Note the code for use on the Gift Aid Settings page. Identifying the Custom Attribute for Gift Aid Items are identified as Gift Aid items via a custom attribute. Under Gift Aid - Settings the custom attribute specifically designated for Gift Aid should be selected so this can be applied to items. From the drop-down select the Yes/No Custom Attribute made for Gift Aid use. Selecting Gift Aid Items In Inventory - Item List chose or create item(s) that are to be Gift Aid Items. Select the Gift Aid Custom Attribute as part of this process to identify the item as a Gift Aid item. In the matrix tab ensure the Gift Aid custom attribute is enabled (set to Yes) At least one item is required a the POS to perform Gift Aid transactions, but you can nominate more than this if desired. POS Customer Capture On transaction payment, when item(s) marked as Gift Aid have been included in the transaction, a prompt will be displayed, asking if the customer wishes to Gift Aid their eligible purchase. Choosing No will allow the transaction to continue without further processing or capturing of Gift Aid data. Choosing Yes will request the required customer details. These details are required by HMRC to satisfy the Gift Aid transaction export. On completion, the receipt and declaration will be printed. If during this process the customer changes their mind then the 'I have changed my mind' button should be pressed and any details will be discarded and the transaction will continue as if the No button had been selected initially. NOTE: there is no validation at this stage that the customer details are valid. The clerk should ensure reasonable details are entered and formatting of details like Postcode are correct. Transactions Exporting Gift Aid Transactions Transactions are exported via the Gift Aid - Transactions menu. The transaction list will be displayed and can be filtered to a specific date range. Transaction rows can be expanded to view detail. Export Data Clicking the export icon will download transactions for the date selected as a .xlsx sheet. If any dates have already been exported then a warning will be displayed but transactions can be downloaded multiple times. You should be careful not to declare a Gift Aid transaction to HMRC more than once.",
