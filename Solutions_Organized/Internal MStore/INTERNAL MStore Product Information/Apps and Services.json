    "text": "Windows MTab program has been migrated to an android app with the same name. It exists as an APK file that can be installed on android devices. The application will use the same SQL procedures as the windows application and the way the device works will be identical. The screens will look a little different as they are android and not windows but the functions on screen and the way they work will remain the same. Knowing how to use the original device or following previous instructions will be enough. There are some nice little changes within the app. They are noted below. App icons using the K3 Logo. Login screen: Information tiles along the top to inform the user of the date/time and activity and status of the device. The ability to not show functions/activities that aren't going to be used by users. By unticking them, the choices will no longer appear on the main menu. I have chose to see only two in the list below. On the main screen there are now only two choices. The options to use external scanner is possible. It might be the device uses an internal or external scanner and won't be needing the camera to scan barcodes. By ticking this box. it will disable the camera screen from showing and auto focus on barcode box ready to accept what is being scanned by the scanner. Diagnostics menu is useful. It will show the version. When supporting the device it is important to know the version. It allows for testing connection to it's local database on the phone, the remote database it connects to and allows for showing logs. Logs will appear on screen. The app will log everything it does. It will show the SQL each time to make errors easier to diagnose. The user can then share them using the normal apps on the phone. As of version 1.2.2 onwards there is an archive function. It can be accessed via the diagnostics option on the main screen. Details look like: Restore will be grayed out if the device is current mid activity/function By clicking restore and confirming, the data will be back on the device as it was prior to upload. The contents can be seen, the data can be edited and resubmitted. This does not delete any of the previous submissions. Anything restored will be removed the achieve and be placed back with new information such as upload times etc. A useful tool for allowing users to reupload data alongside support deleting the data from the server if needed as part of a support issue. 06-01-2025- Feature enhancement - Version 1.3.0 A new feature has been added to allow replacing stock using the check stock function. A new button has been added to the bottom once an item has been scanned. Allowing replacing the stock quantities on items and updating them. This will add a zeroise prior and add the new quantity for the chosen location/s. This is the same as when performed from the back office. This feature can only be used online. It does not place data in to an inspection holding area. Changes made will be be done immediately and can be seen from within the stock audit as normal. This concludes the tweaks to the MTab application for stocking in MStore.",
