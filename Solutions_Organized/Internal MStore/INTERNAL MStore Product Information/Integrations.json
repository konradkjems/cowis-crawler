Rather than checking every second if it is time to run, it can be configured to only check every X number of seconds. This setting is to prevent setups that cause strain on customers servers. Checking every hour seems more reasonable and also prevents silly configuration such as run every 5 minutes. It will only run when this heart beat checks.",
