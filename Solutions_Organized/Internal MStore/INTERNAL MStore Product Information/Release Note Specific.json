Example below where we have added fixed text for “Test Dynamic email content” in the same way you might add text for “Important Information below”. We have added random text which in this instance is the descriptions of the resources the data came from. There is a new merge field. With this in place any content it finds within the dynamic text will display. Any text it finds per resource will be separate by a line break, so it doesn’t form a continuous paragraph. It will distinct the data entered for all the bookable resource data it finds to remove duplicates. This allows for email content to be driven by the items booked online. ** > Feature will need adding to the website for this to work.",
