    "text": "It is important that we provide support for what customers are paying for. This is fair to customers who genuinely have an issue with our software or hardware and who pay us to help them, and it’s fair to K3 that we are not spending time doing work which customers are not paying for (which also means we’re not spending enough time helping customers who are paying for something!). The first part below is mainly for people answering up the phones, but at least the second part applies to anyone working on a support ticket. 1. First, the obvious for people picking up the hotline If a customer calls and wants help with anything which is not related to our software or hardware, then we should not help them because they’re actually stopping us helping customers who genuinely have a problem with what we are contracted to provide.. Examples include if their internet is not working, or they want help with another program installed on their computer/terminal. Believe it or not, this does happen, so don’t be afraid to… Politely explain to them that we can only spend time helping them with issues with our hardware or software. If they ask why – you can give the reason above that we have other customers who are waiting for us to help with our products, and of course, they are not paying for us to be their general IT help (nor do we offer that service!). You could suggest they Google the issue or find their actual supplier/team who should be helping them. Log the call anyway (and resolve as “Not Supported by K3”) so that we can track persistent offenders! If a customer questions something's chargeable, or what's included in their annual fees, you can refer them to What will the Support team help me with? which also includes a link to the full SLA 2. Secondly, the less obvious, but in the same spirit as the above: If you find that you’re doing/are asked to do some work for a customer which is specific to them (perhaps a change to an integration or a question on their config), then stop and think if it should be chargeable. If the customer just needs our help with how to do something, this is theoretically not included in their annual fees (which is for investigating and resolving faults with our products/hardware), so guidelines are: A maximum of 15 minutes should be spent on helping customers with how to do something or any other non-K3 faults. After this, refer the customer to product documentation or a CSM as per Consider how busy you/we are with other tickets for things which are genuine faults. You may need to come back to the how-to customer later. There may be the odd exception where you need to go over the 15 minutes, but this should be an exception, and if this happens regularly for the same customer, then definitely refer to the CSM. If the customer does something to the system which breaks things (e.g. they delete their database, have a virus attack, have a new email server we need to change configuration to work with), then this is chargeable work If the customer needs training or consultancy (or if you're not sure) then contact the relevant Customer Success Manager to ask them (also see Passing Sales Opportunities to CSMs). If you can’t get hold of them, then feel free to reach out to a Support Manager. If it should be chargeable, then the Customer Success Manager will communicate with the customer.

    "text": "TABLE OF CONTENTS Step 1: Is the ticket chargeable? Step 2: What to do if it might be chargeable? Step 3: How to quote the correct rate? Step 4: How to make sure the correct amount is invoiced 4a. Track Time Spent 4b. Get an Opportunity into CRM 4c. Update the CRM info into Freshdesk 4d. Update Customer Success when the work is completed This general guide is for the Support team and CSMs to make the overall process clear, and link to the relevant detailed articles on how to do things This process is intended for small amounts of chargeable support effort, not for larger training and project work which should be referred to CSMs in the normal way Step 1: Is the ticket chargeable? See What Support Tickets are Chargeable / Reserving Support Time for Customers who are Entitled to it Step 2: What to do if it might be chargeable? See What to do if you think a customer has asked you to do some work which should be chargeable Key Principle: if it is going to take more than 15 minutes to resolve, and you're not 100% sure it's a fault with K3 software/code or supported hardware: - Tell the customer it is/may be chargeable - Get their agreement in writing that they will pay if it turns out to not be a K3 fault Step 3: How to quote the correct effort and rate? Effort/Time Estimate the effort to the nearest half an hour. We should not quote less than half an hour for chargeable support work (projects have a higher minimum of one hour, but small support effort work has a lower admin overhead and no project management). Be conservative (round up, not down), and make it clear that it's an estimate based on the best of your current understanding of what's required. It's Time and Materials, so it could take less or more time. Rate See Support Effort Rates / Price List - What and When which includes and a decision workflow to help you select the correct rate. The correct codes should always be used, but CSMs (not Support) can apply a discount or an uplift according to what has been agreed/charged to the customer before (but inflation must always be added from the previous calendar year) Key Principle: If the opportunity/request has come through a Support ticket, then quote the relevant Support rate If a customer is needing chargeable support effort on a regular basis, please refer to a Support Manager who can then discuss with the customer and CSM if an annual amount of hours at a discounted rate should be offered. Step 4: How to make sure the correct amount is invoiced 4a. Track Time Spent See How to keep track of your time on chargeable tickets 4b. Get an Opportunity into CRM Having an opportunity in CRM ensures that the work will be in sales reports and is invoiced. Are the estimated number of hours over 4? YES If the estimated hours are over 4, set the FD ticket to status \"Passed to Customer Success Manager\" and do not do any work until you have confirmation that a signed order has been received No For everyone (except The Netherlands) If the estimated hours are 4 or less, you just need the customer to confirm on the ticket that they will pay at the quoted rate (see How to Choose the Correct Rate ) before going ahead with the work For The Netherlands onlyThe Netherlands team have a semi-automated process which was implemented when they were using CRM for support tickets which applies to tickets where up to 4 hours has been spent: NL How to book chargeable work from Freshdesk to CRM . This creates an Opportunity and an Order, but for everyone else, the minimum requirement is only to add an Opportunity. Regardless of whether the effort is over or under 4 hours, via a Thread on the ticket, send details of the work to: DE: Anita Suwala DK: Dustin Christensen UK: Ashleigh Duckett The CSM team member will enter an Opportunity into CRM with \"FD\" and the ticket number at the beginning of the title (see example below) 4c. Update the CRM info into Freshdesk To ensure that nothing is missed, and that we can reconcile chargeable tickets from Freshdesk with CRM, enter the CRM Opportunity Number into the Freshdesk ticket. Key Principle: Whoever enters the Opportunity into CRM, make sure that the Opp Number is added to the Freshdesk ticket which will mean the CSM team member telling Support on the ticket Thread OR updating the ticket directly if they have the relevant permissions 4d. Update Customer Success when the work is completed Once Support has completed the work: Message the CSM team member and local Finance team member on the ticket Thread to confirm the work is done and how many hours you've spent (make sure it matches up to the amount logged on the ticket!) Resolve the ticket as usual",

    "text": "TABLE OF CONTENTS Introduction Agreements (Office Waalwijk) What to do if you think a customer has asked you to do some work which should be chargeable In case of A chargeable work is over 4 hours : In case of B chargeable work is under 4 hours : Manual for booking chargeable work under 4 hours Introduction This is a temporary process for The Netherlands team to facilitate entering orders quickly. We will use the CRM Case to Order for this which was set up when the Support team were using CRM as it's ticketing system. Agreements (Office Waalwijk) In the Waalwijk Office we have made agreements with the sales department in order to handle chargeable work easier and faster. It is therefore not certain that this procedure also applies to the other offices. What to do if you think a customer has asked you to do some work which should be chargeable For guidance on what is chargeable, please see What Support Tickets are Chargeable / Reserving Support Time for Customers who are Entitled to it As is described on Support Effort Rates / Price List - What and When : If the chargeable work is over 4 hours we tell the customer that for this ticket an Order will be made and pass the ticket to the CSM. If the chargeable work is under 4 hours we don’t need the CSM but ask the approval of the customer and let customer confirm on the ticket, then carry out the work according to its priority and if its an emergency (higher rate) or not.

This means that we end up defragmenting, reindexing their database, checking server memory etc which is not a service we should be performing free of charge, especially when we offer hosting to take that pain away from customers if they don’t want (or have the knowledge) to manage their MStore database themselves. We therefore have the offering published in K3 MStore Database Optimisation and Maintenance Plan – please familiarise yourself with it. There is a behind the scenes technical schedule for what we would do if a customer signs up to the plan. If a customer has a serious trading issue which you think is caused by the database needing maintenance, we will undertake performance optimising tasks, BUT free of charge once per year only (assuming they don’t have the annual Optimisation and Maintenance Plan). If they do not have any tickets in the last 12 months with the tag “DB Maintenance”, then go ahead and do the necessary database maintenance task(s) to resolve the issue. Do not set up any regular tasks, just run whatever one-off job(s) you need to resolve the incident. Tag the ticket with the existing tag “DB Maintenance” so that we can track their annual usage. Send the canned response MStore DB Slow Performance - Fixed One Off. If they do have any tickets in the last 12 months with the tag (I added this tag today, so there won’t be any yet), use the canned response MStore DB Slow Performance - Trading - Won't Fix . If a customer has reporting performance issues which you think is caused by the database needing maintenance, we will NOT do any database maintenance for them free of charge. Please send them canned response MStore DB Slow Performance - Reporting - Won't Fix I’ve set up the three canned responses up so that you don’t have to worry about how to word anything to the customer, and so that we give customers a consistent story.
