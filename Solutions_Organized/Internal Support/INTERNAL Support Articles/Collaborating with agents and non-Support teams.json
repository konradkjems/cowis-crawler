Why Not Use Teams Messages to Collaborate? We can collaborate on tickets using Teams, and occasionally that’s suitable, but in the main, this is to be avoided so that other team members can see what’s going on with a ticket. Keeping a track of all communications about a ticket in the one place (the ticket!) is best for all teams to understand the ticket, and communicate effectivley to the customer.

    "text": "TABLE OF CONTENTS Getting Started Customer Information Useful Reports Support Upsells Tickets How to Find a Ticket and What do the Statuses Mean/Do? View List of Tickets for a Customer Exporting a Support Overview and List of Tickets Getting updates on Tickets with Notes and Threads (discussions) Opportunities/Orders from Support How to Escalate a Ticket Notifications to Customers and CSMs General FAQs Introduction There is a general overview of Support on the Hub here. This article is mostly about how CSMs can get what they need from Freshdesk, but also provides links to other useful information like what extra support services can be sold to customers. Getting Started In FreshDesk, CSMs are set up as collaborators which means you can view tickets and post private comments which the customer can't see (see What is a Freshdesk Collaborator? for more info). First step is to read the following articles from the internal Freshdesk Guide / Getting Started folder (you don't need to read them all because you do not have a full Support agent licence. Customer Information You can see all of the companies and contacts from this menu on the left: You can then filter by clicking the filter button on the top left and select a pre-built filter from the list, or type to search for pre-built filters such as \"DdD\". VIP Customers VIP customers are identified by the CSM Director and Managing Director, and have the \"VIP Customer\" dropdown set to Yes in Freshdesk Companies - see list here. Every time a new ticket is logged for a Company who is a VIP, the ticket gets a \"VIP Customer\" tag. You can see all open tickets for VIP customers in the 9f. Global All Open for VIP Companies ticket view, or search for a region's open VIP tickets by searching the ticket views for \"VIP\": Useful Reports The following may be useful before meeting a customer, or if a customer raises any issues Selected Customer Tickets Overview - gives a useful overview of the type of tickets, how many tickets. SLA adherence etc for a selectable customer and period. If you would like to download a copy of this, you will need to ask a full licence holder (see more info in Exporting a List of Tickets ) Selected Customer CSAT - summarises all customer satisfaction feedback on tickets for a selectable customer and period Tickets currently waiting for a CSM, sorted in nearest SLA due date Open, Passed to CSM Customer MStore Version Numbers Support Upsells By default, all new customers have standard working hours only support, and the standard SLA. Note that customers from before mid-2022 had extended support hours included by default which means that we can't attribute a value to it as it is not itemised (but we can reverse-engineer what it should/would have been which is done on the INTERNAL K3 Retail Solutions Support Options Pricing Model.xlsx Upsells for customers from Support are: Extended Hours. Support hours are described in What days and times is Support available? Premium SLA K3 MStore Database Optimisation and Maintenance Plan Tasks which customers want Support to perform, but are not included in their support agreement (see Opportunities/Orders from Support below) Brochures, PowerPoint, and pricing are contained on SharePoint in Retail Solutions Customer Support - SLA . Tickets How to Find a Ticket and What do the Statuses Mean/Do? You can find a ticket by simply typing in the number in the search box top right. You can see an explanation of what the ticket statues mean, how the SLA is activated/paused by them in Ticket Statuses Explained and How To Use Them View List of Tickets for a Customer If you want to see all tickets for a customer, you have three options: Go to the All Companies view, search for your customer, then click on the Tickets tab You can use the Selected Customer Tickets Overview report. By default the Royal Horticultural Society is selected, but click on the filter drop-down and search for the name of the customer you want to see tickets for. Note the timeframe and other filters are also available. Go to the Global All Tickets Ever Opened view, then filter on the right panel to the company you want to see (and add any other filters such as Created date, or only unresolved (open) tickets in the Status filter Exporting a Support Overview and List of Tickets Only a full licence holder can export a list of tickets. Usually at least one CSM team member has a full licence to do this for other CSMs. There are two ways of exporting a ticket list, but the first method also allows you to export a PDF of an entire report which includes a summary as well as ticket details. 1. The easiest method is by using the Selected Customer Tickets Overview report. Edit the report Clear the filter/previously saved companies by hovering over the company dropdown and clicking the Clear Filter button Change the customer to the one(s) you want , then Save the report You can then export the whole report, or just a ticket lists as described in 1a and 1b below 1a. Export a PDF of the entire report - Click the Export button and choose Email Now (which will email you a a PDF) or Download - Click Select all 1b. Export just the list of tickets Hover over the data in the report, a popup menu will appear. \"CSV of tabula data\" will download a file to your machine which can be opened in Excel (not that once opening, you'll want to save to an Excel file format instead of CSV if you want to add any Excel features such as conditional formatting) 2. The customisable (you can choose specific fields and other filter criteria which are not available on the Selected Customer Report), but more complicated method is to export from a Ticket View such as Global All Tickets Ever Opened Last 6mths which has been filtered. Using a ticket view, full licence holders can export the ticket list to a spreadsheet, but do encourage customers (and yourselves) to use the portal ticket list wherever possible. Collaborators (including CSMs) don't have permission to export which can't be changed, but you can copy/paste the URL of a search result to a full licence holder who can export and send to you (it will include a lot of fields you won't want, so you will need to format it). Suggested format is below. Note that time period as outlined below (defaults to last 7 days!) NOTE that customers need to request if they want to see all tickets for their company as explained on What can you see on the portal? ) Getting updates on Tickets with Notes and Threads (discussions) Please do not go to Support or Development staff direct for updates. You should always review the ticket first to see what updates are there (internal and to the customer). If you do not find what you need on the ticket already, you can add a Note to ask for an update IF: A ticket justifies being escalated, in which case, follow How to Escalate a Ticket and Manage the Escalation. The customer is asking you for an update, and the CSM has checked that they've not found what they need on the ticket, and the customer has asked for an update on the ticket and not had a timely reply You could ask them to request an update direct to Support via the ticket (or escalate to Support management if the Next Response Due has passed). If you post a Note asking for an update, the Support agent owning the ticket should provide a Public update so that you and the customer can see it. A Support Agent may want to consult a CSM on a ticket in which case they may add a Note or Thread and @mention you which will trigger an email to you with a link to reply in Freshdesk. For a brief overview of Notes and Threads, see Collaborate with Ticket Notes and Conversation Threads Opportunities/Orders from Support There is a ticket status of Passed to Customer Success Manager as explained in Passed to Customer Success Manager . This may happen if an Order is required in which case the CSM should ideally enter the order in CRM and add a note to the Freshdesk ticket so that if a customer enquires in future, the Support team can tie it back to an Order if they need to (similar advantage if the CRM order has the Freshdesk ticket number in it). See General Guide to Identifying & Booking Chargeable Work involving Support for guidance on how to make sure that everything from Support tickets is managed How to Escalate a Ticket See How to Escalate a Ticket and Manage the Escalation which includes instructions for CSMs and the support team. Notifications to Customers and CSMs Please see What email notifications are sent to customers? If a Priority 1 ticket is raised, the CSM assigned in CRM (which is imported into Freshdesk) will be sent a notification along with all support managers. Note that the import from CRM is only done every few weeks, so any change in CSM might take a while to be reflected in Freshdesk. General FAQs What if a customer needs help using the Support portal? There are instructions on How to use this portal and what to expect from Support , but if the customer has read them and still needs help, please let the Support Managers know so more instructions can be added What If a Customer Raises a Support Request to a CSM? Ask the customer to raise it directly with Support so that our system recognises the ticket as coming from them (i.e. do not forward an email like this to Support because it will just get raised under your name) If it's not possible or appropriate to ask the customer to raise the request direct to Support (particularly if it's a change you've agreed with them, not an issue), you can email Support yourself and copy the customer. You will get the new ticket notification, but the customer will not. Support will need to change the contact and send a notification to the customer as per How to change the contact on an open ticket",

    "text": "TABLE OF CONTENTS What is an Escalation? CSMs Support Agents Support Management What is an Escalation? A customer escalation is a case that a customer has contacted us about because they believe it's not being dealt with quickly enough. A valid escalation is where we agree it needs management attention because one or more of the following apply: The Service Level Agreement is breached (or near to being breached) It's a critical customer The issue can have serious commercial consequences If an escalation request doesn't meet this criteria, it is not valid. This includes escalation requests from internal people which have not been initiated by a customer directly. Note that this process is not the same as the Critical / Major Incident handling process An escalation could be received via a CSM, or by a customer requesting it in a ticket. CSMs If you receive a request for an escalation from a customer, please follow these steps: Look up the ticket and see if it's within the Resolution SLA, review the priority and activity on the ticket. Decide if you think the ticket should be escalated, or if you need to tell the customer that the ticket is in hand and within Resolution SLA and so an escalation is not reasonable/justified. This might prompt a discussion on if the correct Ticket Priority has been assigned - perhaps the Urgency has increased since the ticket was raised If they are not sure about the Urgency, Impact, and calculated Ticket Priority, please check if they are signed up to the Support Portal and encourage them to sign up if not You might even want to point them to the How quickly can I expect my ticket to be dealt with? which also links to the full Service Level Agreement (SLA) If you think the customer is justified in escalating the ticket, add a Note to the ticket (which will be private i.e. customers won't see what you write) @mention the Support managers in the Note so they are alerted to the escalation request Include in the note the reason for the escalation (summary of phone call or copy of email text is fine) Useful tip: Next to the Add note button, there is also a favourite icon which means if you click it, you will be added as a ticket watcher and will get notified of all updates to the ticket. You can also see a list of all tickets you're watching by selecting the Tickets I'm watching ticket view. The assigned Support manager will carry out the review, update the ticket and update you via a Discussion Thread. This Thread should be where you respond to anything the Support Manager asks/tells you about the escalation (do not add more Notes about the escalation to keep the ticket clear of clutter, and keep all messages about the escalation in one place). Support Agents If you see an update on a ticket asking for it to be escalated, follow steps 1-2 in the CSM section above. If you believe the escalation is valid, update the Escalated dropdown and complete the (mandatory) Escalation Reason box Teams message your line manager, but if they're not available, then message the Duty Manager Note: When dealing with an escalation, the most important thing is ownership and being informative. Escalations is a good example of where there's no such thing as too much information. Always assume that there is someone waiting to get an update. Be proactive with updates rather than making the stakeholders ask for them. Always get help from Head of if you are stuck. Follow standard process for ticket handling, but always ensure it is prioritised. Don't treat it as higher than P2 (unless it's a P1 in which case it shouldn't have needed to be escalated because these are top priority) It is OK to keep chasing people when dealing with these cases, if you don't get a reply, ask again. Support Management Review the escalation request and it it's valid, and update the Escalated dropdown to \"Yes\" (if not already set by a Support agent), or to \"Rejected\" If it's not valid, set the indicator to Rejected and explain why to the CSM or Support agent who can communicate back to the customer If the escalation request was raised by a CSM adding a Note to the ticket, add a Thread to that note and @mention the CSM with an update. If the Support team initiated the escalation then you will need to add a brief Note to be a container for the escalation discussion thread. Adding a thread to the Note will keep all further discussion about the escalation in one place and clear of the main ticket feed. If the SLA is breached/critical customer/serious financial consequences, then this ticket is a valid escalation. Immediate actions are: Escalation Manager and ticket owner revaluates the priority. Support agent confirms to customer that the ticket has been escalated. The Escalation Manager will assist to get appropriate resources involved where needed, and help push to get the ticket correctly prioritised (even if it's with another team like Software Development) Note: the Escalation Manager will not contact the customer direct (this will continue to be done by the assigned support agent). This is to avoid the Support Manager becoming the regular contact point. A ticket can be directly assigned to 2nd line to ensure swift resolution.",

    "text": "TABLE OF CONTENTS Getting Started Dev Teams using Jira Why Access Freshdesk? How are Jiras Created and What's Synchronised? What If a Developer Needs More Info from Support/Customer? What To Do When Closing a Jira Dev Teams NOT using Jira Process for Support to Pass to Development Process for Development to Update Support, and Support to Assign Ticket Process for Development to Pass Back to Support Imagine Product Documentation Getting Started If this is your first time here, you might want to follow the Getting Started section in Freshdesk Guide for Customer Success Managers (CSMs). They will be making more use of looking at company and ticket information than Development need to, but at least the Getting Started should be useful to you. Development team members don't have to look in Freshdesk, but it might be useful... Dev Teams using Jira Why Access Freshdesk? If your development team uses Jira, you don't really need to use Freshdesk, but you do need to understand how/why Jiras are created from Freshdesk, what happens afterwards, and by having a Collaborator licence for Freshdesk, you can click on the Freshdesk support ticket link in Jira if you want to see more details on the Support ticket. Some things you can see on a Support Ticket which you won't see in Jira include if the ticket is for a VIP customer How are Jiras Created and What's Synchronised? If you want to see the process which the Support team goes through to create a Jira, please see Guide for Support to create Jiras for Development from Freshdesk and how Support and Dev can collaborate on them . Note that it's also possible for Support Team members to link a Freshdesk ticket to one or more Jiras (and for one of the Jiras to be selected as the primary one on the FD ticket). - see Updating tickets with an Existing Jira In summary, once a Jira is created from a Freshdesk ticket (Bug or Story depending on if the Freshdesk ticket is an Incident or Change Request), all Jira comments will be synced to Freshdesk, and all Private Notes (i.e. ones which customers can't see) will be sent to the Jira ticket including attachments. What If a Developer Needs More Info from Support/Customer? If a note is put in Jira requesting more information, the Support Agent should see the Note added in the FD ticket and then change the Status to Open (if Support need to get more info) or to Waiting For Customer along with sending the request to the customer. Note that any tickets set to Waiting for Customer which have not had a response after 14 days will be closed (customers receive a reminder after 7 days). What To Do When Closing a Jira There is no automatic notification to Freshdesk if a linked Jira is closed. Therefore, before closing a Jira which has a linked Freshdesk ticket, please post a note in the Jira to say that it's being closed, and why. This note will then appear on the Freshdesk ticket and trigger Support to take action. Dev Teams NOT using Jira Development teams not using Jira can use Freshdesk, but only as Collaborators. This means they cannot be assigned tickets, or change statuses etc, but they can add Notes and Threads (see Collaborate with Ticket Notes and Conversation Threads ) Process for Support to Pass to Development Support will change the Status to \"Waiting for Development\" (see Ticket Statuses Explained and How To Use Them if you want to understand more about the different ticket statuses), Support will then Forward the ticket to the developer(s) - the Forward action in Threads in Freshdesk will just send them an email with a link to the ticket). Process for Development to Update Support, and Support to Assign Ticket You can see all open tickets for Walton (for example) which are Waiting for Development in this view You can also find the view or see all other views by clicking Tickets, then the Filter button start typing to search, or scroll down the list of views. Make sure you are using Table View of tickets and have configured the columns as explained/recommended in Configure fields for the ticket Table View Because Development are not full licence holders, you cannot have the ticket assigned to you, but you can add a Note or Thread to @mention the Support Agent telling them who will be working on the ticket. Support can them assign a ticket to them by using Internal Groups - select the relevant Internal Group, then the Internal Agent if you know who it will be assigned to in the Dev team Process for Development to Pass Back to Support Simply add a Note or add to a Thread a request for the ticket to be passed back to Support with an update as to why e.g. a fix has been delivered, or more information is needed from the customer. Change the Jira to \"Support Review\" status (Support will then change the Freshdesk ticket status). @mentioning the Support agent in the Note/Thread will help them notice the update Imagine Product Documentation Documentation for these products can be found in this Freshdesk Knowledgebase (also known as Solutions) by clicking on the Solutions menu on the left vertical menu bar. The Development teams maintain the product documentation Only contacts logged into https://support.k3btg.com can see articles, and they can only see articles for products which their Company has purchased (i.e. If you have a full Freshdesk licence and are therefore permitted to create/edit articles, there is a whole section on how to use the KB at Guidance on Solutions / Knowledge Base.",

Getting Started If this is your first time here, you might want to follow the Getting Started section in Freshdesk Guide for Customer Success Managers (CSMs). They will be making more use of looking at company and ticket information than Solutions Delivery need to, but at least the Getting Started should be useful to you. The Solutions Delivery team use Freshdesk as Collaborators (free licences). This means they cannot be assigned tickets, or change statuses etc, but they can add Notes and Threads (see Collaborate with Ticket Notes and Conversation Threads ) Process for Support to Pass to Solutions Delivery Support will change the Status to \"Waiting for Solutions Delivery\" (see Ticket Statuses Explained and How To Use Them if you want to understand more about the different ticket statuses), The \"Waiting for Solutions Delivery\" status will then enable the Internal Group dropdown on the ticket, from where they will select \"Solutions Delivery\" If the Internal agent is known/agreed, then they can be selected from the dropdown and Support will Forward the ticket to the internal agent (the Forward action in Freshdesk will just send an email with a link to the ticket) Process for Solutions Delivery to Update Support You can see all open tickets for Solutions Delivery in this view You can also find the view or see all other views by clicking Tickets, then the Filter button start typing to search, or scroll down the list of views) Make sure you are using Table View of tickets and have configured the columns as explained/recommended in Configure fields for the ticket Table View To update the ticket, simply add a Private Note (free licences cannot add public notes anyway). If you want to converse with a support agent or anyone else with a full or free licence, just @mention them in the private note, or use a Thread if it's a discussion which you don't want to fill up the ticket with notes (see Collaborate with Ticket Notes and Conversation Threads ). If you need to send a message to a customer, you will need to add this as a Private Note and @mention the support agent to then send it to the customer If you want to pass a ticket back to Support, then please also add a note and @mention the support agent so they can change the ticket status Note!! If a ticket status is changed to Waiting for Customer (by a support agent), then the customer responds, the ticket is put back into Open status which means that because it's no longer in Waiting on Solution Delivery, the Internal Group and Internal Agent values are reset to nothing",
