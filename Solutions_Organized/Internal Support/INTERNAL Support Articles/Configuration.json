    "title": "SLA Config for Business Hours, Groups, Skills, Automation Rules",
    "text": "TABLE OF CONTENTS Business Hours SLA Policies (i.e. the actual target times) Ticket Fields Groups Skills Automation Rules Original content from Sona email 19th April 2023 subject \"Recommended configuration for Groups and associated features\": Business Hours We need specific business hours depending on the Extended Support Hours like Standard/Weekdays, Standard + Weekday Evenings, Standard + Saturdays, etc for the UK and EU regions as seen under Admin->Business Hours. These hours need to be mapped to the correct timezone, working hours and holidays(if applicable) Example: UK Weekday Standard 9-5:30 only UK Weekday Standard + Saturdays EU Weekday Standard 9-5:30 only EU Weekday Standard + Weekday Evening SLA Policies (i.e. the actual target times) SLA Policies should be set in hours, not days, otherwise the SLA times will not take into account the business hours properly. As per the written SLA, the response and resolution times are calculated only during the hours when a customer is supported How to choose the number of hours? 1 business day is not 24 hours because SLA targets are only calculated in Business Hours (not calendar hours). We could have a separate SLA policy for every permutation of how many hours per day each customers is supported for (e.g. those with evenings, those with no extended hours), BUT that would be overly complex, so a business day is defined as 8.5 hours because only P1s should be worked on out of hours anyway. Exception: For SLA Target Resolution Times which are in Months, we use days because otherwise, a P4 for a customer who is only supported on weekdays during normal hours would be calculated to be a year or more away which is too long. The SLA time descriptions are in terms of Business Days (in which case set \"hours\") or \"Months\" (in which case set days). Note that SLA policies work on \"Type\" and \"Priority\" which are system fields which are kept in sync with Ticket Priority via automations. Ticket Fields We have created a custom dropdown field called Team under Admin->Ticket Fields and included the teams you shared as choices This was done to enable a setup where agents can update the \"Team\" field whenever they need to re-assign the ticket to agents in the appropriate team without reassigning the group itself. This reassignment will be done with the help of the Skill-based assignment configuration. Groups There need to be specific groups for the UK and EU regions corresponding to the Extended Support hour. This is because the Business Hours discussed above can currently be mapped to only Groups, so we need individual groups mapped to the required business hour/support hours. Example: UK Weekday UK Weekday+Saturday EU Weekday EU Weekday+Weekday Evenings You can create additional groups under Admin->Groups and assign the required business hour. Hence, the groups need to be updated to allow Skill-based ticket assignment under Admin->Groups->Group properties. Skills Once Skill-based assignment is enabled, you must create the Skills and associate them with the agents. This can be done under Admin->Skills and each skill needs to include the name of the \"Team\" as the condition as seen in the screenshot. You can also associate the skills with the required agents/team members. Automation Rules . Ticket Creation rules Once the above configurations are complete, you need to create automation rules under Admin->Automations->Ticket Creation to check the Country associated with the contact's Company and the type of Extended Support Hours they've purchased as seen to assign the ticket to the correct group You can review the existing group assignment rules and use the rule UK - Weekday Standard + Sundays/PHs as a reference to build the rest of the required rules Example: Ticket Updates Rules: For cases where the agent updates the \"Team\" field, the automation rule \"If Team updated on ticket - Unassign Agent to recalculate Skill\" will execute and unassign the agent from the ticket. This is done to allow the Skill associated with the ticket to be recalculated and updated to allow the ticket to be reassigned to an agent in the required Team. For example, consider a ticket assigned to the \"UK Weekday\" group and the Team \"UK - First Line\". - If the agent working on the ticket wants to reassign the ticket to an agent on the \"NL - Second Line\" team, the agent can update the \"Team\" field to \"NL - Second Line\". - This would cause the agent to be unassigned from the ticket(by the above rule) and the Skill to be updated to \"NL Skill - Second Line\". - Hence, the system will now check for available agents associated with the skill \"NL Skill - Second Line\" and assign to one of them if available. The \"UK Weekday\" group will remain assigned on the ticket.",
