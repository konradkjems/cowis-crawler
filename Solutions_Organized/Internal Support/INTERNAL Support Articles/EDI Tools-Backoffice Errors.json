Jacob receives an excel file with status report that all the stores have received their sales data or not. In any case,the customer itself also contacts on the same day and inform that which location is missing sales data. According to Jacob,if a store has missed data for today due to some reasons,it should be read out anyway in the next run following the coming night.

    "text": "In editoolbox,all supported clients can be observed regarding their backoffice error count.These errors can be reduced or vanished proactively before the customer can contact us any query regarding their itemgroups. The following link (requires support username and password) gives access to get an overview of different clients as shown in the screenshot. http://editoolbox.dddretail.com/#/ We can also observe a single client by using the tools option in the above link by entering a specific client id. As in this example,the client id is 295001 for customer BySiW Aabybro which shows backoffice errors with a total number of 20. Every store has a unique GLN(Global Location number-13 digits) which identifies a specific store location and is the first step in communicating via EDI within business. By clicking the backoffice error tab as shown in the below screenshot,different information about the errors are documented which helps in identifying the errors. In this case, we are focusing only on Fejl varegruppe EDI errors which indeed needs mapping of different items groups in EDI tool and DdD backoffice for a specific customer. The number of errors vanishes as soon the item groups are correctly mapped in EDI and DdD backoffice.The error logs can be sent to a specific email where one can get a csv file(we need only csv file with pricat information). After a specific user email is entered,the error log files are being sent to that specific email. Normally,3 files are received with information describing PRICAT,Despatch advice and OrderResponse.Here we will focus only on the file with PRICAT as shown in the below screenshot. The pricat csv is processes with data manipulation and the file shows different information about the supplier,EDI item group number,type of the product,EAN number and the type of error. Column I represents the item group number in EDI that must be match with a specific item number in DdD backoffice. Column K represents the product information and thus column X represents the item EAN code. AC shows the particular supplier for that item and AE shows specific error regarding to that item. In this case the error type is Fejl varegruppe EDI. As we have observed the EDI itemgroup numbers as shown above,the next step is to map them regarding their specific itemgroup in DdD backoffice.If there is no matching a new specific item group can be created and then mapped back with EDI itemgroup number.In such case,the new itemgroup must be communicated with the customer and should be approved by them. As shown in the below screenshot,the item groups are being matched regarding to the product type. 1703 is EDI item group which belongs to the category SkIRT and in backoffice,it can be mapped with itemgroup 72 The mapping table is shared as below. The mapping of these itemgroups according to specific supplier are done in EDI tool by using the following link and requires DdD support tools username and password in order to access the tool. https://editool.dddretail.com/EDI/EDIMainPage.aspx The setup here shows different information about EDI setup for a specific customer and an overview of list of suppliers. Please note that if an itemgroup belongs to one than more supplier,so it must be mapped to all respective suppliers. The supplier b.young is shown in this exampler and we found out from the csv file that there are 4 itemgroups for the supplier b.young. In this case, by selecting b.young,we will create 4 extra rows and enter the particular details as shown in the below image. After clicking on save mapping,the particular mappings are matched and press continue. More mapping can also be done by selecting other suppliers as Cream and Culture. When all mapping is done,we will notice that most of the backoffice errors are resolved or reduced. In order to observe that We can go back again to EDI tools for customer 295001. Click on scheduled Task as shown below and wait for a few seconds. We can observe that the number of errors are now reduced from 20 to 6.",

In this case,We are assuming supplier name Street One with a supplier number 5. We can login to EDI tool using our support login credentials with the following link. editool.dddretail.com/Login.aspx Enter the respective Group number (728 in this case) and then choose EDI type 96A and check for the available clients as shown in the below screenshot. Here,the only active store is 728002. In Order to register new supplier,Click on Insert new EDI Partner and click on Insert new EDI Partner as shown in the below screenshot. The next step is to fill the supplier details and then click on continue.The details required are Supplier GLN number,Tnr and supplier mapping(5) as from backoffice supplier number. The details for supplier Street One with id 3 is entered and make checkboxes for different options as shown below in the screenshot. Then click on Continue and the new supplier is now added to the customer in EDI tools.",
