You need the cusomter's help for this. Touch each target firmly. Then touch the green checkmark to finish the calibration. If you cannot finde ELO on the Task List, you can assume it is not running. Open Control Panel, Programmes & Features and check if the ELO driver is installed. If it is, open it, and run the calibration from there. If not, go to https://www.elotouch.com/support/downloads#/ and choose the appropriate driver for the Windows version. Install the driver, run the calibration and have the sales clerk try touching the targets again. If this still does not work, have the sales clerk shut down the PC, pull the power plug, and leave it without power for 10-30 seconds, then plug it in again and restart. Should this fail as well, then it is possible that the POS needs to be repalced.",
