    "text": "Electronic invoicing (also called e-invoicing or einvoicing) is a form of electronic billing. E-invoicing includes a number of different technologies and entry options and is usually used as an umbrella term to describe any method by which a document is electronically presented from one party to another, either for payment[1] or to present and monitor transactional documents between trade partners to ensure the terms of their trading agreements are being met. These documents can include invoices, purchase orders, debit notes, credit notes, payment terms, payment instructions, and remittance slips. Purpose The accounts payable department ensures all invoices from its suppliers are approved, processed, and paid. The main responsibility of the accounts receivable department is to ensure all invoices are created, delivered and subsequently paid by their vendors. Processing an invoice includes recording relevant data from the invoice and feeding it into the company's financial or bookkeeping systems. After the feed is accomplished, the invoices go through the company's business process to be paid.[2] An e-invoice can be defined as structured invoice data issued in electronic data interchange (EDI) or XML formats, possibly using Internet-based web forms.[3] These documents can be exchanged in a number of ways, including as EDI, XML, or CSV files.[4] The company may use imaging software to capture data from PDF or paper invoices and input it into their invoicing system. Many companies hire a third-party company to implement and support e-invoicing processes and to archive the data on their own servers.[5] The file extension .INV could be used. The .INV file can be in standards-compliant XML format. History Since the mid-1960s, companies have begun establishing data links with trading partners to transfer documents such as invoices and purchase orders. Inspired by paperless office, they developed the first EDI systems. At the time, there was no standard for electronic data interchange. The Accredited Standards Committee X12, a standards institution under the umbrella of ANSI, moved to standardize EDI processes. The result is known today as the ANSI X12 EDI standard.[6] This remained the main way to exchange transactional data between trading partners until the 1990s, when companies began competing. New web-based applications allow for online submission of individual invoices as well as EDI file uploads, including in CSV, PDF, and XML formats. Suppliers could also see a history of all the invoices they submitted to their customers without having direct access to the customers' systems. This is because all the transactional information is stored in the data centers of the third-party company that provides the invoicing web app.[7] According to a 2012 Global E-Invoicing Study, 73% of respondents used electronic invoicing to some degree in 2012, a 14% increase from 2011. Supplier resistance to e-invoicing has decreased from 46% in 2011 to 26% in 2012.[8] By 2022, a leading provider reported a 78% increase in the number of invoices processed through its platform over a two-year period.[9] According to a report done by the GXS in 2013, Europe is adopting government legislation encouraging businesses to adopt electronic invoicing practices. The United States Treasury estimated that implementing e-invoicing across the entire federal government would reduce costs by 50% and save $450 million annually.[10] Standards Various standards exist. The EU's Directive 2014/55/EU on electronic invoicing in public procurement noted that \"several global, national, regional and proprietary standards exist; ... none of them prevail and most of them are not interoperable with one another\".[11] EDIFACT UBL (Universal Business Language)[12] Finvoice (Finland) EHF (Elektronisk Handelsformat) (Norway) E-Invoice (Estonia)[13] FacturaE (Spain) Factur-X (France) FatturaPA (Italy) CFDI (Mexico) ISDOC (Czechia) E-faktura (Poland) OIOUBL (Denmark) PEPPOL BIS (various countries) Svefaktura (Sweden) UBL-OHNL (Netherlands) ZUGFeRD, XRechnung (Germany) Nota Fiscal Eletrônica (Brazil) Facturación Electrônica (Ecuador) DTE (Chile) Under EU Directive 2014/55/EU on electronic invoicing in public procurement, the EU commissioned the development of a \"European standard on electronic invoicing\".[14] Usage To enable e-invoicing, there must be an existing method of viewing the transactions, typically an ERP (enterprise resource planning) or accounting system. Once routing is established in the system, validation rules can be set up to reduce the number of invoice exceptions. Once the e-invoicing specification testing is complete, the business's suppliers will be connected electronically.[15][16] Government-mandated Several governments and tax administrations imposed e-invoicing formats in their respective jurisdictions for business-to-business (B2B) transactions, and required that the emitted documents be stored in centralized repositories, often controlled by the tax administration. Mexico, for example, introduced the CFDI format in 2004 in Appendix 20 of its Tax Code, requiring that all invoices be stored with the Mexican Tax Administration.[17] Non-standard invoices have been banned by law since 2012. Chile implemented a similar system in 2003,[18] and Colombia in 2020.[19] In the European Union, France introduced mandatory government-controlled B2B e-invoicing starting in July 2024.[20] This obligation has existed in Italy since 2019.[21] The primary goal of government-controlled e-invoicing is to reduce corporate tax fraud. Per a research paper published by the Harvard Kennedy School of Government, Mexico's tax-to-GDP ratio rose from 12.6% to 16.2% between 2012 and 2017, driven largely by a 48% increase in revenue from tax on goods and services after e-invoicing was made mandatory. The Malaysian Government declared in the 2023 Tax Budget that mandatory e-invoicing will be introduced for businesses with an annual turnover exceeding RM100 million starting in June 2024. By 2027, all businesses will be required to adopt this electronic invoicing method.[22][23] The United Arab Emirates announced its e-invoicing initiative in July 2023. The Ministry of Finance plans to roll out mandatory e-invoicing for B2B and B2G transactions by July 2026.[24] This system will follow a decentralized model, initially covering domestic transactions with potential future inclusion of B2C transactions. The initiative aims to enhance tax compliance and reduce administrative costs.[25][26] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_invoicing",

The support or delivery team will take care of the setup. This should be the first step because you have to enter this transport route ID for each B2G address, together with the routing ID. It would be double work if you had to enter the routing ID first and then enter the transport route ID afterwards. When the transport route has been created. Enter it together with the routing ID in the B2G address. You will receive the routing ID from your customer. (When creating a new process in the orders area, the routing ID is \"pulled\" from the address) Your address in the addresses area in Cowis.Net If you have several branches, this applies to every branch from which you create invoices. In the addresses area, enter the address of the sending branch. You do NOT have to fill this address with an address type: MANDATORY fields are: Company Name1+Name2, telephone and email Example: Branch 1 Branch 2 Enter this address ID (in this case 1 and 2) behind the respective branch You go to Article -> File -> Branches You select the branch to be changed with Change and enter the created address ID Branch1 Branch 2 Please check whether your VAT ID is stored in the print parameters area in order processing (if not, please enter it): Orders -> Settings -> Print settings -> Print parameters",

So you go to Orders in the Cowis.Net Back Office Then you go to Settings -> Standard settings -> Transport route for XRechnung There you press NEW You enter a description, ideally the same one for all customers, the same \"B2B invoice\" Always set the transport route and compression like this Then comes the part where the customer, their hardware partner or their software house has to work with us. We need to know the access data for the sender email address and the customer's email server. The customer has to give us the information marked in red. The sender email address should be the one with which the customer wants to send their X-invoices, usually something like \"Invoice@Company.de\" The customer should be able to give us the settings marked in red. Otherwise you can try with these settings. Otherwise it will take a long time. After each setting and change you have to click \"Test now\" to see if the email was sent successfully. If it was not successful you will definitely get an error log. But you cannot create a knowledge base here because a different message can appear depending on the setting and mailbox. Test settings Test in progress Test result, here an error when receiving emails, but that is not relevant. But you can't make any generalizations here and there is NO universal solution (even if you would like it to be that way) You can only try to send an invoice afterwards and see if it arrives. The last thing left for support is to set the parameter so that X-invoices can be created and transferred at all. To do this, go to Settings -> All in the order processing Search for the parameter XRe, set the value to Yes and save That's it, there will be similar instructions in the customer support area where there will also be further help articles",
