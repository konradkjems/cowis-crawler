Points & Levels Points Points are awarded to agents based on how fast they resolve the tickets assigned to them. There are also bonus points for first-call resolution and satisfied customers. Agents can also lose points for late resolution of tickets and for unhappy customers. This is how the points are currently allocated. Agent Levels An agent can reach higher achievement levels as they gain more points. Trophies & Quests Trophies The points awarded are added towards trophies that can be viewed from within the dashboards. Trophies are based on different criteria and an agent can receive one of 4 trophies. Quests Quests represent performance goals that are set for agents, for completing them they will be awarded badges of honour and additional point bonus.",

There is an app each agent can install if they wish, and an automation for P1 portal tickets as described below TABLE OF CONTENTS Freshdesk / Teams app How to Install It How/Why Use It? P1 tickets from the portal Freshdesk / Teams app How to Install It Full instructions can be found on The Microsoft Teams App : Freshdesk , but that includes a lot of info for Administrators, so quite simply: From the left panel, click on Apps and search for Freshdesk. Click Add. How/Why Use It? You can use it to be alerted in Teams to updates on tickets you're watching in Freshdesk. You can install it to see how it works and if it’s useful for you, or just ignore it! I’ve documented the Freshdesk app and how to install here. Below is an example of what you can get (including clickable link to the ticket) is shown below (after clicking on the Freshdesk app which appears on Teams chat like a person or any other chat would. P1 tickets from the portal We should be aware as soon as a P1 from the portal is created. It’s not possible to create a P1 from email without one of us updating the ticket, and by definition, all P1s from phone are known about by one of us already, hence only posting about P1s from the portal The integration only allows posting to a public Channel, but I know that most people don’t monitor posts in the channels very much, and new messages in Chats are much easier to see. So the mechanism is that Freshdesk posts to the relevant channel in the Support team as shown below (this is just for information, you don’t need to monitor the channel) We have a Teams Workflow which detects posts to the P1 channels, and posts a link to them in the relevant normal country chat as shown in the example below for a UK P1 which happened this afternoon while I was configuring this Clicking on “Click here to see more details” in the chat post takes you to the Channel post which then has some basic information, and a clickable link to the ticket in Freshdesk The chats being posted to (as applicable) are “DK Support chat”, “UK Support Chat”, “Waalwijk - Daily Support Chat”, and “P1 Teams Chat Germany”. When you see the post, as per the instructions in orange in the example above, someone from First Line (or Second Line if First Line not available) should like the post in the chat so that we know someone (and who) is responding.",
