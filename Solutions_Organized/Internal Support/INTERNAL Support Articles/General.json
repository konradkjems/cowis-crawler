    "text": "TABLE OF CONTENTS Get the Data Format the Data Backup Live Data before Upload Upload Data Post Upload Checks Expired Contracts Ex Customers Appendix - Known Data Issues Get the Data Logon to an RDP session i..e use the RDP login for X3 so that you are on the company network Open Companies_and_Contracts_from_DataWarehouse_for_Freshdesk from https://axk3btg.sharepoint.com/sites/SDSupport-SupportLeadersandCSOps/Shared%20Documents/Support%20Leaders%20and%20CS%20Ops/Freshdesk%20Implementation/Data%20to%20Upload/ (you may need to email this link to yourself and open up Outlook on the RDP/X3 machine) In the Excel, click the Data menu and select \"Refresh All\". This will refresh all data in the sheets \"Contract_Customers_Merge\" and \"Contract_Summary\" Save the sheet, then you can exit the RDP session and work on the spreadsheet from your local machine. Format the Data Ensure that the first row of the \"Companies_for_CSV\" and \"Contracts_for_CSV\" have formulas which point to the first row in the \"Contract_Customers_Merge\" and Contract_Summary sheets respectively If they don't, then you'll need to do a Find and Replace on the first row in the CSV sheets to change the tow number to 2 Delete all data from the CSV sheets except the first row Select all cells in the first row, then drag down to the same number of rows as in the source sheets and ensure that all original rows are included, and there are no empty rows Company Name and Contract Name cannot have duplicates, so duplicates are automatically highlighted in red on each CSV tab, so filter by colour to review duplicates as per sections 8 and 9 below On the Companies for CSV: Sort by Company Name (asc) and Non-Global Product (desc) Delete all rows where the CRM Account Number or Company Name is empty or 0 Delete all rows where the company name includes \"terminated\" which is sometimes done in CRM For those which have a i) duplicate Account Number AND ii) a Duplicate Company Name (i.e. both are red), AND iii) different products: Merge the values in the Non-Global Product column and the following 3 columns (Imagine Customer, Data Switch Customer, Viji Customer) as in the example below. Note: a. Some rows will just be complete duplicates, or have an invalid product like \"LAPTOP\", b. MAKE SURE THE FIRST ROW OF THE DUPLICATES IS THE ONE WITH THE CORRECT VALUES BECAUSE THE SECOND ROW WILL BE DELETED IN THE NEXT STEP This: Becomes the below by over-writing the formula with the hard-coded value: Delete the \"unmerged\" row (2nd row in the example above) For any where only the company name is a duplicate Check which ones are already in Freshdesk, and delete the other duplicate rows from the Companies_for_CSV. It is likely that the duplicates are actually just stores, but they're defined with their own account in CRM Alternatively you can contact the CSM to have them rename one of the duplicates if they are separate valid accounts which should both be in FD Use Excel's Delete Duplicates function (in the Data menu) to delete all duplicates for Account Number AND Company Filter for where the Non-Global Product is blank AND the other three products are blank (i.e. the Company has no products associated with it) Check if they are in Freshdesk, and if so, update the product in the Companies_for_CSV sheet. If not, delete the row or update if in the Known Data Issues table below Filter for any where the Product is not one of the ones we support, and delete them Replace any departed CSMs for one that is still at K3 (CSM Owner and CSM Owner Email columns) On the Contracts for CSV: Sort by Contract Name Delete all rows where the contract name includes \"terminated\" which is sometimes done in CRM Filter by colour to review the duplicates in the Contract Name column Delete any duplicates where the contract expiry is blank It's likely they are complete duplicates, in which case simply delete the remaining ones by clicking on Data/Remove Duplicates and delete based on the Contract Name Filter for any where the Product is not one of the ones we support, and delete them (including the 3RDPARTYOTHER product which is usually a duplicate with a real product) Address known issues with data as per the table at the end of this article Backup Live Data before Upload Export all Companies from the Export option on All Companies Download data for Contracts using Contract + Site Custom Object Upload Data Export the two _for_CSV sheets to CSV files and save in the same location as the Excel *but easier to have a local copy as well for uploading) Go to Companies : K3 Support (k3btg.com) and click the Import button Once you have dragged and dropped your file, you will then need to select the correct mappings between the CSV and the Freshdesk fields. Some are automatically mapped, some not. Some fields such as \"Extended Support Hours\" in FreshDesk do not have a corresponding column it the CSV as that information is not available in CRM or X3. Same applies to import Contracts at Contracts You will receive an email with the upload report and attached will be any records which didn't import You can ignore errors \"name [\"Value can't be blank\"] in the Company CSV because that's most likely a lot of blank lines at the end of the CSV You can re-download the companies from Freshdesk and do a comparison if you want to see The contract import will have some failures due to an ampersand or any other special characters not being permitted, but some of our company names have ampersands in them or other special characters. This is a bug which FD have not fixed yet. the error message is only \"invalid input\". For contracts with special characters, check if the Contract Expiry Date needs updating Some may fail if there is no matching company name. Check to see if you can find the company name, but if none found, then no action to take Review all contracts which were not updated/uploaded and add or amend in FD as required Post Upload Checks Expired Contracts Once all updates are complete, check for any expired contracts in the bottom widget on the Contract + Site Custom Object report (change the widget filter date by editing the report), and extract to CSV to check with Finance. Report data takes 30 mins to populate after the import - What is the refresh time for the data in Analytics? : Freshdesk If any of the expired contracts are found to be genuine (not a data issue), then put the company on stop if they have no other valid contracts as per How to Handle Ex Customers and Closed Sites Ex Customers Check if the ex-customers in the system have had a non-ex customer uploaded (i.e. a duplicate). This shouldn't happen if the customer really is an ex-customer. Do this by: Download all Companies Replace \"EX-CUSTOMER - \" in the Company Name field with blank Select the Company Name field and Conditional Format for duplicates Filter by colour to find any duplicates and delete from Freshdesk as necessary Appendix - Known Data Issues Identifier (Company or Contract Name) Issue Fix Frandsen P/S Two account numbers for same name customer Delete row for ACC064853 (keep ACC064891) fahrrad.de (multiple companies which start with this) They only have Imagine, not DdD Update any Companies which do not have Imagine Customer set as TRUE Delete any DdD contracts Kabooki Neumunster Incorrect/no product Set to DdD Newquay and Paignton Zoo CRM and FreshDesk previously worked on one account called South West Environmental Parks which is what the customer is used to, but each import creates a new FD company for Paignton and Newquay Update the single Contract Helpdesk : K3 Support (freshdesk.com) to have the same contract details as the freshly imported ones Delete the Paignton and Newquay contracts and accounts after each import related to Paignton Zoo ACC022436 Newquay Zoo ACC021425 .",

Go to the customer portal and place the cursor on the name of the field that you are looking to customize. Right-click and select \"Inspect\". The \"id\" of the field would be displayed as seen below which you could then copy and use in the code. Doesn't seem to be a way of finding this on the internal portal, so you will nbeed to make the field editable by customers, and then put on the submit ticket form, for example, so find the internal name.

    "text": "NOTICE: Only for application managers !!!! The ComponentCleanup process is part of the Windows Deployment Image Servicing and Management (DISM) tool. It removes unused components and reduces the size of the WinSxS folder. Here’s how you can start it manually: Method 1: Using DISM Command Open Command Prompt as Administrator: Press Win + S, type cmd, and select Run as Administrator. Run the Cleanup Command: Execute the following command: cmd CopyEdit dism.exe /online /cleanup-image /startcomponentcleanup Explanation: /online: Targets the running operating system. /cleanup-image: Specifies the image to clean up. /startcomponentcleanup: Cleans up superseded and unused components. Wait for the Process to Complete: The process might take several minutes, depending on the size of the WinSxS folder and the system’s state. Method 2: With ResetBase to Prevent Rollbacks If you want to perform a more aggressive cleanup (removing old versions of components and preventing rollback to older updates): Run the following command: cmd CopyEdit dism.exe /online /cleanup-image /startcomponentcleanup /resetbase Note: Using /resetbase makes it impossible to uninstall previous updates, so use it carefully. Method 3: Using Task Scheduler If you prefer to trigger ComponentCleanup through its scheduled task: Open Task Scheduler: Press Win + S, type Task Scheduler, and hit Enter. Navigate to the Task: Expand Task Scheduler Library → Microsoft → Windows → Servicing. Look for a task named StartComponentCleanup. Manually Run the Task: Right-click the task and select Run. Verify the Cleanup After the cleanup, you can check the size of the WinSxS folder to confirm the reduction: Run the following command in Command Prompt: cmd CopyEdit dir %windir%\\WinSxS /s This shows the size of the folder before and after cleanup.
