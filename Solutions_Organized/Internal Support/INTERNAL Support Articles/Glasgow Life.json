Project Handover document from Feb 2025 - Hardware Delivery to Support Handover Checklist.docx All 3 sites have had a complete install of Pos receipt printers scanners and cash drawers. These are the first phase of replacing their hardware ready for Imagine deployment. RMS has been reinstalled and is configured in the same way that they were using previously, there have been no changes made to this. In case of support calls related to hardware here are 2 pictures showing the new Pondius Pos system and the relevant connections. There is no remote access to any GL sites so all support is triaged verbally. We do not support their non integrated card terminals or attached document printers. There are no specific usb ports assigned to the peripherals so plugging devices in to any port is fine.",
