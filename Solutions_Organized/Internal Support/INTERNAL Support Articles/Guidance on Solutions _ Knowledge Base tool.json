Images/screenshots are good to help people understand and keep them engaged. If the article is long, then use the TOC button on the toolbar to insert a Table of Contents. The TOC does not update as you add more sections, so add the TOC last, and if you add more sections when the TOC is already there, you will need to highlight the TOC and click the TOC button again (i..e delete it and re-add it again) Note that the TOC does not update as you add more sections, so add the TOC last, and if you add more sections when the TOC is already there, you will need to delete it and re-add it again You can add notes in a box by clicking the add button on an empty line, and choosing which type/colour note you want to add.

Searching for an Article To do this, simply click on the \"Insert Link\" icon or click Ctrl+K and select the Solution Article tab (from where you can search for your article). Once your article has come up in the search results, you can either: Click the \"Add\" button which comes up when you hover over the article OR Click on the article to open up a window which shows you the contents, then click the Add button, then click the arrow top left of that window You'll then be back at the screen below where you can click on the Insert button to finally insert your link Here's the example! ** READ ME ** Copy/Paste the Link On any article which you are viewing or editing, you can click on the Copy Link icon and paste that into another article. Beware!! If you use the search dialogue box or the link button described in the two sections above,, the link will take you to the portal view of the article. This is because it's designed with linking public/customer articles in mind which is great... The only way to get around this if you are linking internal articles and dont' want to go to the portal view is to copy the address from the browser address bar, but it will then paste with the generic display name of Helpdesk : K3 Support (freshdesk.com) which isn't very helpful (you can of course change this by clicking the link when editing an article and change the display text.",
