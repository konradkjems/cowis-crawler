    "text": "Introduction This article describes what great customer service looks like, and provides general principles of how support staff should operate to provide that good customer experience. Support plays a vital part in ensuring that from early engagement with customers (usually via K3 consultants) during implementation, through to Production live steady state, and enhancing their system, customers receive great service which means that: They remain customers They buy more products and services They are happy to provide great references to new customers/prospects The principles in this article should also be extended to how the Support Team deal with partners and internal staff. What Great Customer Service Looks Like to Customers The following are what customers should expect and experience when interacting with the K3 Support Team: Quick, caring response Regular updates on open tickets Knowledgeable staff Proactive service - to be informed of issues from other customers which might affect them, or product updates No passing of the buck (not being told that it's waiting for another internal team at K3 and given the impression that it's nothing to do with Support) Customers don't have to explain the problem multiple times to different people Receive honest responses (see more guidance below!) Treated with respect (even if query or issue turns out to be spurious/wrong etc) Easy to escalate if required and justified Easy access to see my open tickets and statuses Ten Principles of Delivering Great Customer Service It is not always possible to fix or deliver everything as quickly as a customers might like. The following are general guiding principles of how Support Team members should conduct themselves to deliver the best customer satisfaction possible: Be polite, calm, and professional in all interactions with customers Empathise with the customers They may be under extreme pressure from senior people in their organisation to have something resolved quickly, even though you may not think it's important. Even if the customer is wrong, don't make them feel like they're wrong Provide regular updates even if there is no new update from another internal team you're waiting on There is a documented schedule of the minimum expected update frequency in Keeping Customers Updated Be responsible for calls you log or are assigned to Even if the next steps are waiting on someone else, chase up a response (internal or external) and do not use assignment to another internal team as an excuse to the customers. It's ok to say it's been passed/escalated to second or third line support because it gives an indication of how seriously we are treating something, but be clear that you are chasing those teams on the customer's behalf. Stick to personal pronouns such as \"we\" and \"I\", not \"they\" or \"them\" e.g. \"We are investigating and expect to have an update by the end of today\", not \"They are investigating and expect to give us an update today\" Make sure you pass a ticket onto another colleague if you are going on holiday etc Be helpful to other team members Team members have different experience levels - there's no such thing as a stupid question If a response comes in for a call which you don't own, but you know that the owner is not available or an action is required ASAP, then progress the ticket in your colleague's absence Respectfully help people out with process, prioritisation, or workload as required. Proactively asking someone if they would like help, or suggesting an alternative way of doing something (without being abrupt/telling them they're doing it all wrong!) If you promise something, make sure you do it, and do it when you say you will If something changes that means it won't be possible, let the customer know in advance (i.e. don't let them chase you when something's not done as they were expecting). Manage expectations - set expectations, but don't give unrealistic timeframes We often can't provide an estimated fix date/time at first, but we can provide expectations on when the next update is going to be If we give a time frame to provide an update, make contact well before the end of that time frame If there's a blocking issue internally, update the customer in a manner which is informing them of the problem, but without airing our dirty washing (so, truthful updates without necessarily explaining internal problems which are none of the customer's concern) It's ok to make a mistake if you were working to the best of your understanding and ability, but... Take steps to make sure it doesn't happen again Document the pitfall so that others don't make the same mistake Provide clear and accurate communication Read your own ticket update before sending to make sure it's clear and unambiguous. If you're not 100% sure about the accuracy of your communication, double check with the source (if applicable). If the update has come from another source, e.g. a software developer, then rephrase it to be friendly/understandable for the customer where applicable. Be commercially aware Don't spend a long time working on an issue which you think is not covered under the customer's contract - escalate to a Support Team manager Don't tell customers that something will only take \"a few minutes\" for example/ If it's chargeable, pass on to to a CSM as per Passing Sales Opportunities to CSMs to have a quote done properly in case we set the wrong expectation Refer to What Support Tickets are Chargeable / Reserving Support Time for Customers who are Entitled to it",

If there is only one customer affected by the same issue, please follow How to handle a P1. If it is a Major Incident: It is likely there is a financial impact on multiple customers i.e. affecting customers' immediate ability to trade, It could be a whole service being down (e.g. Imagine). A Major Incident might also be declared if there is a potential significant financial impact on K3 because it may result in K3 having to pay compensation, or losing one or more major customers. Declaring a Major Incident Support receives a phone-call for a P1 Incident (P1s should be raised by phone, but may be raised via other channels) Support logs ticket and does initial triage. If triage reveals that one or more services are down (could happen for a P2 which you realise needs to be changed to a P1), or there is a performance issue so severe that effectively a service is down (i.e. multiple customers affected), create a Tracker Ticket and notify the Major Incident Manager (MIM) The MIM will be the Support Manager for the region, or the most available Support Manager - UK: Richard; Europe: Odd - If Richard or Odd is on holiday or not available/contactable (e.g. due to being on a customer site), then contact the manager who is available - If a MI occurs near the end of the European normal working hours, then it would usually make more sense for Richard to be the MIM if both Odd and Richard are available If further details are required to determine if it's a MI, MIM asks Support for further troubleshooting / info from customer. MIM declares a Major Incident if appropriate and creates an internal Master-ticket (which MUST be in English) Managing a Major Incident If a Major Incident is declared, whoever is best to investigate/resolve the Problem MUST drop their other work and work on this 100% until it is resolved This includes people from all teams in Retail Solutions All other tickets should be opened (per customer) and linked to the Master Problem ticket. MIM starts a Teams-chat with involved support and other staff trying to resolve the issue, and names it with the ticket number and product (e.g. K3CS-12345 Imagine\") MIM provides management/stakeholder updates as per MIM Instructions below The impact and troubleshooting steps must be clear from the ticket description (see General Ticket Management) If Support determines that help is required from other teams, DM will contact personnel for the appropriate product (see Key Contacts for Duty Managers) When you forward a Major Incident to a new function, they must be notified via chat or call and acknowledge ownership. If Cross-team internal collaboration is required - MIM will add them to the Teams-chat and may set up and chair a Taskforce meeting. Actions must be documented concisely in Teams-chat made and may be included and sent out to the Retail Solutions management team in the next update. When Incident is resolved, MIM ensures the ticket is closed MIM declares Major Incident over and informs all parties Within 1 week, MIM writes and populates the Master ticket with Incident report. (Can be done in resolved status) As soon as possible after the Incident report, a root cause analysis and how we will prevent/mitigate this in future will be sent to all customers who contacted us during the Incident. Use existing Tracker ticket is possible, but if time is exceeded, you may be required to open a new Problem record with link to original Incident. Process Diagram Major Incident Handling Process.vsdx Major Incident Log The Major Incident Log.xlsx is a list of all Major Incidents since October 2022. The completed reports can be found in CS Global Support - Support Leaders - Major Incident Reports - All Documents (sharepoint.com) Major Incident Manager Instructions The Support Major Incident Manager is accountable for the resolution of any Major Incidents Communication During the Incident MIM posts to internal stakeholder/senior management Teams chat DURING the Incident - Chat is named \"Retail Solutions Escalations (group chat for posting urgent customer issues)\" MIM sends management updates about the Incident to the Retail Solutions Escalations group Teams chat every 2 hours (minimum) Template for initial notification: Summary including affected service/product: Ticket number: Customers affected: Time of discovery: Business Impact: Immediate actions: Next update in: MIM is a single point of contact (SPOC) for escalations and Major Incidents If the MIM is working with an Incident, that must take priority over business as usual (BAU) tasks until resolved. The MIM is responsible for setting up a group chat with involved team/people who are trying to find the cause and resolve the MI. Major Incident Report (story telling AFTER the Incident) A Major Incident Report is for internal use (after the incident has been resolved, and within 1 week of it being resolved). The Major Incident report should be sent to appropriate distribution list, depending on the products and customers affected. You will need to get a root cause from the Product Owner assuming a software or infrastructure issue was the cause. When you are writing an Incident report, you are telling a story. Anyone who reads an Incident report needs to understand what has happened, when and by which team. Use timelines and team names. The template report to take a copy from is CI-000 (CA-XXXXX) Major Incident Report TEMPLATE.docx which is in the folder of all previous Major Incident Reports CS Global Support - Support Leaders - Major Incident Reports Key Contacts for Major Incident Managers In case of Major Incidents, these are the main contacts you can use to help investigate and resolve Incidents (and these people may not be able to help, but should know who can if not) Who is on out of hours shifts Shifts are managed in a single Shift app in MS Teams (\"Retail Solutions Customer Support\" team).

Problem Record (Tracker ticket) Initial Categorisation and Prioritisation is key See the principles on Setting Case Urgency, Impact and Priority The initial category and priority dictates how we deal with the ticket and ensures that we work on the highest priority issues affecting tradign first, bu don't forget the lower priority ones. One call/request one ticket Tickets can become complicated and hard to understand if they consist of several different requests, and makes the SLA impossible to measure (e.g. a customer might complain that a ticket's been open for a long time, but actually we resolved the original issue quite quickly) Any time you receive a call or email regarding a new issue, a new ticket must be logged. Don't let customers add more issues to same ticket (e.g. on an email chain) - otherwise we get complaints that ticket X has been open for 8 weeks when actually we solved the original issue much sooner Customer calls about a ticket that was previously resolved - Open a new ticket as it is a new issue. If another customer calls about an on-going problem where one or moe Incidents are already created - Create a new ticket If you get a call about an on-going case - Make a note in the existing ticket (don’t open a new ticket) Indicators that a ticket includes more than one request is that there are >50 comments/updates (which makes them unreadable for others and hard to digest), and if the original issue was solved or not Keep Tickets Updated Respond to customer updates and requests for more information according to the Next Response SLA - see Keeping Customers Updated and Next Response SLA Support tickets should be updated with all major investigation info and all updates to customers included (regardless of whether you called or emailed the customer). Ticket updates should be made throughout the ticket lifecycle, not just at the opening and closing of a ticket. Why? Colleagues are able to check on progress if required (e.g. the ticket owner is away or if there’s an escalation). Customers do not escalate tickets due to a lack of update/contact from Support. Incidents (Any disruption to service or reduction in quality of a service) If there is a P1, please follow this process: How to handle a P1 If this affects multiple customers and is a P1, consult Major Incident handling Perform thorough troubleshooting. Put appropriate info in the ticket. Example things to consider: Restart the service (POS, Backoffice, PC) Are other stores impacted? (The staff may not know this. Many will have internal communication channels and can quickly find out for you) Try log on teamviewer on a different store and test. When did the Incident occur? Has it happened before? Troubleshooting steps so next level resolver can see what has been done - example below: Step1: Restarted PC Step2: Cleared Cache Step3: Unplugged all cables and plugged back in When to Resolve a Ticket? If you request information and they don't respond, then if you've chased them two more times and have no response, then close the ticket (normal expected timeframe - 2 weeks) If the customer confirms that you have provided a solution/fix, then close it. If you do not receive any confirmation, then you can close a ticket two weeks after providing a resolution (during the two weeks, make sure the ticket is set to a status which shows everyone that we're waiting for the customer to respond) Workbooks - close immediately then reopen within 2 weeks (after that, new ticket) CRM - close immediately then reopen within 2 weeks (after that, new ticket) UNLESS customer is using the CRM portal, in which case set to \"Awaiting Customer Closure\" Problem Record (Tracker ticket) A problem record needs to be created by a Support Manager for any issues which affect multiple customers - see How to link / use a Tracker ticket if multiple customers report the same issue What are our lessons learned and how will we prevent the Incident from happening again (Link to the Incident) Root-cause analysis: 5 why's?

    "text": "TABLE OF CONTENTS Why? How Quickly Should We Respond to Customer Updates? How Often Should We Proactively Update Customers? Tickets should be kept updated as per \"Keep tickets updated\" on General Ticket Management Why? No news is bad news! Keeping customers updated is critical because even if not much has happened on a ticket, or not much progress has been made, updating customers with even a \"we're still working on it\" at least makes them think that we've not forgotten about them/their ticket. How Quickly Should We Respond to Customer Updates? If a customer requests an update on a ticket, or if they provide information (or any other update), then the ticket status will be changed to Customer Responded as per Tickets Statuses Explained and How to Use Them . As soon as this happens, the NExt Response SLA timer will start. The next response due can be sorted on and viewed as a column in ticket views. The targets are below: Ticket PriorityNext Response Due Within 1 1 hour 2 2 business days 3 4 business days 4 8 business days 5 12 business days Targets are higher for Premium SLA customers How Often Should We Proactively Update Customers? If a customer responds to a request for further information from us, or requests an update on a ticket, we should respond in the same timescales as the Target Response Time on the Global Standard SLA For proactive updates, the targets below apply during their supported hours (i.e. not on a Saturday if they're not supported on a Saturday, not at 10pm at night when they're not supported and we're not working!). If we are waiting for a customer to get back to us on something, this frequency still applies for chasing them. Example is if we ask for more info that we need to investigate a P2, and they don't respond within 1 business day, then we should chase them at that point. If they still don't respond, then another day later you could email to say that the ticket is on hold and if we don't hear back soon then we'll assume we can lower the priority of the ticket. Priority Update Frequency (minimum) Days exclude weekends (unless a P1) and Public Holidays 1 Every two hours 2 1 Day 3 3 Days 4 1 Week 5 2 Weeks Tickets with other teams If a ticket is with another team, such as the software development team, you should get an update from that team and pass it onto the customer. This may mean that the other team gives you an ETA for the next update or solution delivery which you can pass on to the customer (and therefore you don't need to update every 1 day for a P2 for example) Support are responsible for updating the customer and delivering a solution to them (even if we can't solve it ourselves)",

    "title": "Telephone Etiquette - how to handle customer phone calls",
    "text": "Use a Professional Greeting When answering calls from customers, you need to sound professional to create a good impression. Let the caller feel the smile on your voice and use welcoming phrases like: Good morning. How can I help you? Thank you for calling. Don’t forget to mention your name and the company. If there are many departments in the company, let the caller know the department they have reached. Answer With a Smile A friendly voice tone will create a good impression when talking over the phone with a potential customer. The best way to achieve that is by talking with a smile on your face. Besides setting a tone for the entire phone conversation, smiling will improve the caller’s confidence. They will also smile back at you, setting a good mood. Listen Carefully Callers always want to be listened to when speaking on the phone. Please focus on the conversation to make them feel cared for and valued. Avoid multitasking during the call. If the caller discovers that you are doing other things, like typing on a keyboard, it sends a message that their concerns are less important. If you must take notes, let them know.

Let the caller feel the smile on your voice and use welcoming phrases like:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul type=\"disc\"><ul type=\"disc\"><li>Good morning.</li><li>How can I help you?</li><li>Thank you for calling.</li></ul></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Don’t forget to mention your name and the company. If there are many departments in the company, let the caller know the department they have reached.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h1><strong dir=\"ltr\">Answer With a Smile</strong></h1><p>A friendly voice tone will create a good impression when talking over the phone with a potential customer. The best way to achieve that is by talking with a smile on your face. Besides setting a tone for the entire phone conversation, smiling will improve the caller’s confidence. They will also smile back at you, setting a good mood.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h1><strong dir=\"ltr\">Listen Carefully</strong></h1><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Callers always want to be listened to when speaking on the phone. Please focus on the conversation to make them feel cared for and valued. Avoid multitasking during the call. If the caller discovers that you are doing other things, like typing on a keyboard, it sends a message that their concerns are less important. If you must take notes, let them know.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h1><strong dir=\"ltr\">Empathise with the Caller</strong></h1><p>Callers get comforted when you show them empathy, especially if they feel frustrated with the predicaments facing them.

    "text": "To maintain/increase customer's perceptions of our care for them: 1. Ask if there’s anything else we can help with when on the phone to customers. We voted narrowly not to do this on the basis of concerns raised. I’ve now had the chance to review with Mark, and he is very keen that we give it a go and monitor the results and workload. If you are on the phone with a customer and resolving a ticket (regardless of what type of ticket): Ask them if there’s anything else you can help with If they say “Yes”, then ask them if they’ve raised a ticket already If they say “Yes”, then you can have a look at the latest status (if they don’t have the ticket #, it should be easy to find via their contact record), and if you’re not the agent assigned to it, promise to ask the assignee to update it. If they say “No”, then you can offer to take down the details and raise a ticket for them, or if you need screenshots etc, then suggest that they raise a ticket via the portal, and you’ll keep a lookout for it (offer email if portal is not possible). If they say “No”, then you’ve hopefully at least given them the warm fuzzy feeling that we’re very helpful, and it’s also nice to know the customer is otherwise happy with the system! It’s really important that if you promise to do something like lookout for a ticket being logged by them, that you do as you say - reminder of #6 on Principles of Great Customer Service 2. Call customers to chase if there’s no response within 5 days We agreed that it would be a good extension to our personal customer care touch if we could phone customers if we’d waited for a response for 5 or 6 days i.e. before they get the auto-email telling them that we haven’t heard from them for 7 days, and the ticket will automatically close in another 7 days. Guidelines for this are: If you’re 90%+ sure that you’ve answered the question/solved an issue, then call them just to check that’s the case If you’re waiting for information to help you progress, call them just to explain that, and make sure they understand what they need to provide (but don’t offer to do it for them if it’s going to take a long time) If they do not answer the phone, make sure you add a Public note onto the ticket to say you’ve called – I added a Canned Response for this (in English – Odd can arrange for translations) which you can use (you might want to use as-is, or tailor it before sending). To help you with this, there is an automation to email the agent owning any tickets that have been waiting for customer for 5 days. It will also add a tag “ChaseCustomerAfter5DaysWaiting\" which you can use to track tickets as well.",

    "title": "Setting Ticket Urgency, Impact and Priority",
    "text": "The general principles of assessing the priority of a ticket apply regardless of the system and are documented in the Service Level Agreement (SLA). Impact and Urgency Impact is a measure of the effect of an Incident. Urgency is a measure of how long it will be until an Incident has a significant business impact. The definitions of Urgency and Impact are and copied below: Rating Urgency Impact Low A resolution can be scheduled for when is mutually convenient. Superficial and does not materially impact functionality. Medium Needs to be addressed soon to prevent any further deterioration. Impacts functionality, but continued use is possible. High Requires immediate attention. Affects the majority of users and/or prevents use of the system. Only Incidents have Urgency and Impact; Service or Change Requests only have Urgency Priority The table below defines the priority levels applied to Incidents which is calculated from the Urgency and Impact. The priority of an Incident may change throughout its duration. For example, a Priority 2 Incident may be upgraded to Priority 1 if an Incident affecting some users spreads to all users; or a Priority 1 Incident could be downgraded to Priority 2 if a Workaround is provided in advance of a permanent fix. Urgency Impact Low Medium High Low P5 P4 P3 Medium P4 P3 P2 High P3 P2 P1 Tickets which are not Incidents (examples include an enquiry on how to do something, or an enhancement request) will be assigned a Priority according to their Urgency only i.e. a priority of P3, P4, or P5 for Urgency of High, Medium, or Low respectively. Examples The circumstances of the same Incident determine its Impact or Urgency. An example is where a store has four Point of Sale (POS) solutions and one develops a fault which renders it inoperable (hardware or software): During a quiet period when customer numbers are low, this might have an Impact of “Medium” and an Urgency of “Medium” (resulting in a Priority of “P3”). If the same Incident were to occur in a very busy period, the Impact would still be “Medium” (because other POS solutions are operable), but the Urgency may be “High” (resulting in a Priority of “P2”). Note that in the extremely unlikely event that all POS solutions were inoperable in a location, this would be a High Impact and High Urgency Incident, resulting in a Priority of “P1”. What is a Site / Location? A site / location is a trading outlet. Therefore if a business has three areas it does business from in the same location (e.g. cafe, souvenir store, ticket sales), they should be treated as a whole Site / Location. So if their souvenir store only has one till, then if that goes down, it's a P1. The same applies for a website - it should be considered a separate location/site, so if a website we are responsible does not work, then it's a P1 as that whole \"Site\" is not able to trade.",

    "text": "TABLE OF CONTENTS What is MTD? Who Manages MTD Tickets? Who Manages the MTD Tickets? First Line Support Second Line Support What To Do With Tickets Raised to Retail Solutions which Should NOT Have Been What is MTD? Making Tax Digital is a UK-only app on the Imagine platform - the app sends data to the UK Government HM Revenue & Customs department. Who Manages MTD Tickets? The MTD code is managed by NexSys. MTD runs on the Imagine platform which is managed by Retail Solutions Who Manages the MTD Tickets? First Line Support Customers should log tickets with their ERP provider i.e. NexSys, IBS or Walton depending on their relevant ERP Package (IBS and Walton are both Retail Solutions, so wil raise a Freshdesk ticket anyway). For customers using ERP packages that were originally provided by K3 eg Navision, Sage etc who only make use of MTD and no other K3 Solutions, they should raise a ticket with NexSys as per NexSys (SysPro) Products and Support Contact Details. Second Line Support Retail Solutions act as second line support for MTD requests where they relate specifically to the Imagine platform, so if the individual ERP provider cannot resolve the issue they will raise a ticket with us via the Freshdesk customer portal (they will be linked to company K3 NexSys ) which should be for product \"Imagine\" and Component \"Making Tax Digital (MTD)\". When tickets are logged, they are automatically assigned to Tom Toulouse via the rule screenshot below. Mike Lawrence is added as a Watcher in case Tom's not available (it's not possible to assign the ticket to multiple agent). Tom/Mike will then investigate, and if they suspect a platform issue, they will create an Imagine Jira with all the information required for Development to look into the issue if required/as per normal Jira process. Note that there are some KB articles on MTD: Search for MTD articles We should not be communicating with the end customer if the tickets is logged with NexSys by the customer - that will remain NexSys responsibility using the information you provide them on the Freshdesk ticket. Make sure the relevant updates are public because although NexSys a K3 team, they won't have access to the internal FD portal to see private updates from Jira etc) What To Do With Tickets Raised to Retail Solutions by Customers Which Should NOT Have Been If customers do raise a ticket with Retail Solutions, then inform the customer of the NexSys Support contact details. To resolve the ticket, they will need to be associated with a Company. Add the contact to company Non-Retail Solutions Making Tax Digital Customers Resolve the ticket as Not Supported by K3 (even though it probably is supported by non-Retail Solutions K3!), or something else appropriate if it's a Change or Service Request they are raising. This is better than deleting tickets because we want to keep a track and be able to report on, and do something about customers who keep coming to us when they should not be.",

    "text": "Taking Care of Customer Data You should already be aware of General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR) - our policies can be found on Policies (sharepoint.com), but in Support we need also need to be aware of some of the principles in System and Organization Controls (SOC) (even though we are not audited for it). Customer data, particularly financial (and medical) has extra protection in law. If a copy of customer data is needed to be transferred to K3 equipment to investigate an issue: The best method to use is TeamViewer. If TeamViewer is not possible for any reason, then use a K3 FTP site where available. As a last resort you can use an online file transfer site but only if the data is encrypted or at least password protected by the transfer site. Make sure that you always ask the customer to encrypt/password protect the file before transfer if we are not using TeamViewer to get the data ourselves (TV transfers are encrypted as per End-to-end encryption (E2EE) | TeamViewer ). Once we have the data, it should be kept encrypted, and when you unencrypt it to use it (e.g. to load into a database), delete the unencrypted as soon as possible, and once the issue has been resolved, all co[pied should be permanently deleted from K3 equipment Key Rule for Everyone, Every Time We should not transmit or store unencrypted customer data Changing Customer Data Key Rule for Everyone, Every Time If any situation requires a change to customer's live data, then you must have the customer's written approval (in the ticket) before you make the change. Further guidance The above does not apply to configuration data/settings changes. If you are not sure if the customer has authority to make data changes (especially if via a phone call), then ask them if they have authority, and if you or they are still not sure, ask them to check with their management before proceeding (and check with a Support Manager if you're not sure). If you think the data change is high risk, consult a colleague before going ahead. Ideally you will take a back-up of the customer's data before making a change. Give a high-level explanation of what data is being changed, and why e.g. \"Please confirm that you approve changing the transaction references on all transactions affected by the system crashing. The risk is low of any unintended consequences of doing this\". If you are on a phone call with a customer, and you are also logged on to their system, and need to make a data change, if it's a real emergency and can't wait for customer approval, then you must get their verbal confirmation and tell them that you will email them afterwards from the support ticket confirming what you have done, and requesting that they respond to confirm they were aware and are happy with the data change. This is designed to keep the customer, you, and K3 safe from any consequences (which can be severe) of making a data change",

    "text": "If a P1 is happening for multiple customers with the same underlying cause, please refer to Major Incident Management . If there is a P1 which has been verified by First Line Support as a customer being unable to trade in a location (e.g. coffee shop, website), then this ticket becomes top priority for everyone involved. If FLS cannot solve it, contact SLS and check who’s going to work on it and assign to them. The FLS person must not just pass the ticket to SLS - they need to make sure someone in SLS is aware of it immediately (so message them, check for a response, call them, talk to them if in the same office!) The SLS person should stop working on anything else (obviously there might be some exceptions such as in the middle of an upgrade or phone call, but then another SLS should be dealing with the P1 anyway if available). Dialogue between FLS and SLS should continue – FLS checking if SLS need any help updating the customer for example, or at least keeping an eye on progress. If a valid P1 is raised during normal hours and continues after supported hours, then we would normally expect the ticket owner to carry on working on it out of normal hours or handover to someone who can. TOIL can be claimed if a significant amount of effort after hours is required (except management usually can’t claim!) If a P1 is raised via the portal, then a Teams message is sent to the relevant country's chat. If it's raised by phone, then by definition one of us knows about it, and if it's raised via email, then again, one of us has reviewed the email and changed it from the default P4 to a P1, so the above procedure can be followed ASAP",
