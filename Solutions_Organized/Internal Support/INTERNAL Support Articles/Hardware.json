    "text": "Stock Take using PDA Handheld Stock Take Upload Process following scanning items to handheld: On The PC/Laptop From Merac Back Office. Click on Stock Take/Receipt Icon. Zeroise Stock by Supplier and/or Location you plan to count Stock against. (best to zeroise All Stock Locations to prevent future inaccurate Stock Valuation Report figures) On any Back Office PC/Laptop Click on the Stock Take/Receipt Icon. Ensure that ‘Honeywell PDA’ is set as the Data Source and choose the appropriate StockTake/Movement type from the drop-down box to the left. Click on the drop-down box marked ‘File name’ to the right-hand-side and then select the StockTake record that matches the date/time you uploaded your data (i.e. probably the latest one). Click Upload Selected Transmitted Data button. The data will populate in the grid below. Delete any rows you do not want to upload and click ‘OK’ to update the Stock records. Un-Tick the ‘Add to stock figures where a previous stock take exists within the last 30 days’ check box. Click OK Check a couple of items have the correct stock figures using the Stock Maintenance/Movements screen for a given Stock item. On the Honeywell PDA scanner, go to Data Tasks (OK). Select ‘Delete Collected Data from handheld’. Finished Stock Take using the Handheld PDA: Summary:- Date/Time (UPDATE) Refresh Stock Codes (gets new Stock Code updates from server) Select StockTake from the main panel and then set the ‘To Location’ and ‘From Location’ Scan items Upload Collected Data from Handheld Steps:- (using an Optimus barcode scanner) Before carrying out a Stock Take, prepare the device by connecting the barcode scanner to your Back Office PC and click Send Data button to upload the current Stock Data Stock Codes to the Optimus scanner. Disconnect the scanner and start scanning items, reconnect the Optimus to your Back Office PC and select the ‘Stock Adjustment Type’ and ‘From Location’, ‘Supplier’ and ‘To Location’ if appropriate. Click on ‘Upload Collected Data from Optimus’. The data will populate the grid below. Delete and rows you do not want to upload and click OK to update the Stock records. (using Honeywell PDA handheld barcode scanner) Before performing a Stock Take, ensure that the date/time is correct and the device has the latest Stock Codes. On the PDA handheld when initially powering it on, update Time and Date by selecting ‘Update’. The date/time update will successfully complete provided the device has a WiFi connection to the network. OR If the device is not connected by WiFi, attach the PDA handheld to a Merac Back Office computer via USB cable and using Windows Mobile Active Sync (for Windows XP) or Windows Mobile Device Center (for Windows 7), update Date and Time by selecting ‘Update’. On the PDA handheld, the Merac Stock Control app should open automatically. Select DataTasks/StockControl: select ‘Update’ again and then ‘Proceed’. Enter PIN (known by customer as their Till Login PIN number). On the PDA handheld, select DataTasks/StockControl (OK). Select ‘Refresh Stock Codes’ which does the following - connects to the Merac database and pulls down all up-to-date Stock barcodes then over-writes the handheld scanner’s local Mobiledat.txt file with up-to-date Stock Codes. Wait for the device to update. Once updated, click Close. If the device has carried out a Stock Take before in the past, select ‘Delete Collected Data from Handheld’. Then select ‘Stock Take’ option from the main menu within the Merac Stock Control app and begin scanning stock items once you have specified the ‘Stock Adjustment Type’ (e.g. StockTake), ‘From Location’, ‘Supplier’ (if Adjustment Type selected is ‘Receipt From Supplier’) and ‘To Location’ (if Adjustment Type selected is ‘Move Stock’). Movement Types: Scan each Item, ensuring you type in the Quantity after each scan and press ENTER on Keypad. Continue until all stock is counted. Select Data Tasks/Stock Control (OK). EXIT If not connected to WiFi, connect the Honeywell PDA Handheld PDA to your Back Office PC. On the Honeywell PDA handheld, go into Data Tasks: ‘Upload Collected Data to Server’ and select ‘OK’. This will copy the counted Stock information to Merac Back Office from the handheld connected to the PC. Connecting the Handheld PDA device to your Merac server for the purpose of carrying out a Stock Take requires that the Mobileini.txt text file stored on the PDA device located within the My Device folder needs to contain the following similar lines of information. Obviously the server IP Address needs to match that of the SQL server IP Address… Note! Make sure that there is no or character following ‘SERVER=’. Each PDA Handheld StockTake device used for Stock Take at a site requires a unique DEVICEID. The newer version of the Handheld software only contains one single line for the Server and Database path. For the older version of the Stock Control software, once all scanned Stock has been uploaded to the server from handheld, the MobileUpd.txt file remains on the device and the contents can be cleared for the next Stock Take using DataTasks>>‘Delete Collected Data from Handheld’. For the newer version of the Stock Control software, once all scanned Stock has been uploaded to the server from handheld and before a new Stock Take begins, choose DataTasks>>‘Delete Collected Data from Handheld’, the MobileUpd.txt file is renamed to a format of i.e. MobileUPDArch20160105124922.txt and then archived into a folder on the device. The program will warn the user if the Mobile.UPD has not yet been uploaded but the end-user will be given a choice whether they would like to delete the file anyways. The ‘Delete Collected Data from Handheld’ procedure searches for all MobileUPD archive files present i.e. those beginning with MobileUPDArch… and offers the user the choice to delete them but they may choose not to. PDA Handheld Scanner Stock Control Process Summary Install Microsoft ActiveSync Center (for Windows XP) or Windows Mobile Device Center (for Windows Vista and higher) Connect the device to the PC via USB and using the mobile device connection software above, browse the device using File Explorer. Delete Mobile.upd file (original StockTake file storing counted Stock from previous Stock Take) if it exists!!
