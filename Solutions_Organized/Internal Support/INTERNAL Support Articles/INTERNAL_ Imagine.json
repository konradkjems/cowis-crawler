    "text": "NETS Card terminal not working Monday, 3 October 2022 09.29 Example startup complete: WIP Once you have the startup complete receipt you can troubleshoot the card terminal. If you don’t have one, restart the connector. If ECR is red on the display on the cardterminal. Step 1: Restart connector to get a start-up complete receipt. Step 2: Find the Merchant card on the bottom of the cardterminal Step 3: Swipe Merchant card Step 4: Press 6 Step 5: Press 1 Step 6: Press 2 Step 7: Press the arrow beneath the display on the cardterminal until it says \"komm. type\" Step 8: Press the green button Swipe the merchant card through the terminal, it's usually at the back of the terminal. Press 6-1-2 and then press the arrows beneath the display on the terminal until it says \"Komm. type\". Press the green button to edit and press the arrows again until it says \"Ethernet\" then confirm with green. Then press red button once and then 3 for \"Kasse\" and then press the arrows again until the screen shows the option \"Komm. type\". Press the green button to edit and then the arrows until it says \"IP Ethernet\". Press the green button. Then press the arrows until it says 'ECR IP adresse' If the IP address on the display corresponds to the startup recipe and a restart of connector and terminal have been done then the issue lies elsewhere. Proceed to section 2 for further troubleshoot otherwise proceed below. If not then press the green button to edit. If there's already numbers here press yellow to delete that. Now you need to insert the IP address that is on your startup recipe. The IP format is \"XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX\" (192.168.100.199). If there is only 1 or 2 numbers in the IP then you need to add an extra 0's. Eg. \"002.010.001.050\" Enter the numbers as shown on the startup complete receipt. When you have inserted the correct IP address press the Red 'STOP' button twice. The card terminal will now reboot. Wait 1 minute and then restart the connector, after a few minutes, the 'ECR' should turn green. Section 2",

    "text": "Difference Between App and Browser Wednesday, 8 February 2023 15:19 The reason it is more effective to run the Companion as a PWA (app) is because it creates a shortcut on the device desktop which is easier to access and runs full screen, and is usually always logged in. Running it in the browser means that the user has full access to browser controls, like the browser back button (which will behave differently to the back buttons in-app), the address bar (which means they could browse away from the app without noticing and wonder what has gone wrong) or clear local storage (which would impact offline capabilities amongst other things as well as log them out). These factors mean that when running the software on a large number of devices, for which we do not have remote control access for it would be very difficult for us to control and support. We should not get a support ticket for example because they pressed the browser back button which caused them to lose their stocktake counts.",

    "text": "Diagnosing P400 Ped asking for merchant Login issues 24 August 2022 16:19 Diagnosing P400 merchant Login Required issues in Imagine Normally when there are issues regarding the new P400 ped displaying the message “Merchant Login Required” a complete power cycle of both the ped and the Connector will resolve this as the login information should be sent automatically to the Ped by the Connector. Also doing a clear cache of the browser will clear any Card terminal transaction flags that may be stuck. The Login information cannot be entered manually by keypress on the Ped. If this doesn’t work then some debugging will be required in order to find out if the Ped is indeed on the network and responds to a ping. Firstly some details about the Ped need to be obtained from the customers Imagine setup. Login to the customers Tenant normally one setup for k3 access can be found in the Tenant users list. For our customer Courtauld galleries this would be Courtauldgalleryk3admin the password is Password1! Use the Portal Admin/Connector manager Module to display the details as below. This will give you the IP address of the relevant Ped which you want to check returns a ping. Remote onto a machine on the customers local area network (preferably the Till) and open a command prompt and do a ping to the IP address of the Ped. If this returns a reply then we know the Ped is on the network. If this doesn’t return a reply then it’s time to contact the customer and advise them to have the network connection checked on the Ped and then retry the power cycling of both Ped and Connector again to check that it logs in ok automatically. If it still doesn’t work go to next step. Run Dev Tools (F12) whilst the Pos is at login screen and select “Network” tab then select Config?Posid Header and check Response. (see below) The local IP address for the connector can be found here. If there are more than 1 Pos on the network make sure the Pos that you are remoted on to and the Terminal IP and connector mac address match as in the connector manager setup shown previously. Copy over the Putty.exe app (it may already be on their desktop) if you did connector training then you will already have this. Run Putty and fill in the IP of the Connector as shown below and make an SSH connection to the connector IP. Login to the connector using pirate and password l2k0110team Once logged in run these commands to display the P400 logs which will determine if the Ped has a stuck transaction. cd compose docker logs compose_k3pay_1 If you see information like below then the Ped will have a stuck transaction and have to be returned to Verifone and a replacement arranged accordingly with Verifone. Best to email them at Ocius.customer.services@Verifone.com the details of the Ped by asking the customer for the SN on the back of the Ped and the Merchant account ID which is in the Connector Manager Pic above. Also send them a screenshot of the log.",

    "title": "Guide to Gathering Info for Imagine Issues",
    "text": "Here are some hints and tips for investigations into Imagine issues. Certainly before passing a ticket to Dev ensure that FLS have performed basic checks such as: Ensuring the POS is running the latest version. See POS User Interface for info on how to check POS version. Power cycle of the Till, Connector & Card Terminal (if issue with POS/Payments). See Connector Articles - Restart connector for info on how to restart the connector. Checking cable connections & till-roll in printer. Once basic triage has been completed, SLS will need to gain detailed information on the issue. The Network Tab on Chrome dev tools or the network request view in LogRocket is a great way of knowing where an error has occurred. If the failed network request is pointing to an Imagine URL this is most likely an issue with Imagine itself. If the failed network request is pointing to an IP address this will point to an issue on the connector. Further details from the connector can be found by reading the relevant docker containers log file. The response from the failed request may help point you to a possible resolution that may not require dev intervention. See HTTP Status Codes for a definition of HTTP status codes. Make sure if you want help from others (e.g. Development), that you explain fully what you've done, what your evaluation of that info is (don't just pass a log file or screenshot) Good examples of details to send to Dev include (try to include as many of these as possible): Screenshots of any errors that may occur. Replication steps (if applicable). Export of Chrome Dev Tools Network tab/LogRocket session detailing the issue. See Importing/Exporting a HAR File for information on how to export a HAR file from Chrome. LogRocket sessions can be quite lengthy. Try to utilise the crop feature to isolate the error to make it easier to navigate. Details of exactly where an error occurs in the process. E.g. if issue related to transactions, does the error occur after payment has gone through on the card terminal, or before, etc. Screenshots of relevant Connector log files. See Connector Articles - Accessing Docker Logs for information on how to read connector logs. Details of error from microservice logs. See Imagine Microservice Logs (Grafana) for information on how to query the Imagine platform logs. Remember that if you do pass a ticket to Dev, that screenshots/images need to be passed as attachments (not pasted in-line because the integration only sends over plain text, although you can do both for clarity in FD if you want to)",

    "text": "Logrocket is basically a monitoring tool that allows us to watch user sessions which are recorded in the production. It show us a replay of what clerks/users did on the Imagine portal and can help the developers to inspect network requests and response logs. This is done in order to track some useful information in case of error tracking and help developers to identify and help them to solve issues. All Imagine customers are usually enabled for logrocket sessions in platform admin. To get access to logrocket application, a support agent must be invited by logrocket admin account. The agent receives the invitation by email and when accepted the support agent can login to the account and can track recording sessions for every respective active client. The logrocket dashboard screen shot is shared as below. In search bar we can filter our search on the basis of different parameters. Every session shows us the user details and also the date and time of that session. We can also customize time range for the sessions in order to find a specific date or interval. When a customer reports an issue, we can search the user by different parameters user id,name,email and location etc. In relation to Imagine, we normally search a customer by their tenant id which in this case is a UserID as shown for that customer in platform admin. In this example, we are using user id that contains 250.It allows us to track all the recordings for UserID 250 for all their stores/shops. We can track a specific data and time reported by the customer and can explore it further. When a specific interval is tracked, the respective activity is clicked and it opens the corresponding recording with various monitoring information. The Network tab, Developer tools needs to be set active and one can track the error logs by observing the small red bars in the play video session. In this case Error 400 is observed as red and is bad request and directs the developer team to explore further the problem relating to Infrasec Integration.",

    "title": "Imagine Microservice Logs (Grafana)",
    "text": "Grafana is a tool that allows you to view the logs that come directly out of the various microservices within Imagine. Errors from Grafana are especially useful for the Dev team as they will typically include the code error which will point to the exact lines of code the error occurred in and a more comprehensive explanation. This gives a lot more detail than the simple toast errors in Imagine or even the request response from Dev tools/LogRocket. For an introduction please see Grafana Training Video The Grafana stats page can be accessed at https://grafana.k3imagine.com/ and logged into with the following credentials: Username: support Password: Ret@il123.! Grafana runs in two environments (as noted in the top left of the welcome page), these environments are: K8S002 - Imagine non-production environment (i.e. RC, Dev, Test). K8S003 - Imagine production environment. To start building a query navigate to the explore section from the burger menu in the top left: The first step is to ensure you're querying within Loki (as noted by the drop-down in the top left) and add a label filter for \"namespace = im-prod\": Within the Kubernetes cluster everything is separated out into namespaces. All of the Imagine services reside in the \"im-prod\" namespace so this is the only one we're interested in for Imagine. In the top right there is a date/time filter that can be applied to your query. Please note however, logs are only stored for 7 days: If you were to run this query as is you'll notice a graph detailing the volume of logs below your query editor over your set timeframe and further down the text output of the logs. Since we're only filtering on the im-prod namespace this will return lots of data and further filtering will most likely be required to find exactly what you're after. The type of filtering needed will depend on the type of issue you're trying to investigate. A good start is to filter only to errors. You can do this by adding \"exception\" into your line contains filter: You can then filter down further by adding the Tenant ID into the query. To do this you'll need to add two more line filters for \"tenantid\" and another for the specific Tenant ID you're searching for: Most but not ALL services include the Tenant ID in the logs. Therefore, if you can't find a specific error it doesn't necessarily mean it's not that but simply may not include Tenant ID. Try removing or changing some filters. Once you're happy with your query filters simply click the \"Run Query\" button to execute it. In the logs section, enable the \"Prettify JSON\" option to make this more readable: You'll then see the logs that match your filtering criteria in JSON format: If collating this information for Dev, include the entire error message from the \"@x\" key. The Request Path, if available is also useful information to include.",
