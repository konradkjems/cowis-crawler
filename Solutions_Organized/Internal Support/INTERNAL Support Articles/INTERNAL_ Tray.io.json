    "text": "Tray.io is an integration platform used by K3 to integrate K3 products into other 3rd-party systems. Tray.io has superseded DataSwitch Cloud and all previous DSW Cloud integrations have been migrated into Tray. Tray is currently primarily used to integrate Imagine tenants with other 3rd-party platforms but ultimately is product agnostic and can be used to integrate any K3 Products with most 3rd-Party Software. Tray.io is also used by K3 as a data migration tool from legacy systems into Imagine. Logging Into Tray At present, all SLS consultants who support Tray have been setup with their own individual logins to the K3 instance. New logins to the K3 instance will need to be requested from an admin and will need to be given relevant permissions to the various workspaces within Tray. To login to Tray navigate to https://app.eu1.tray.io/login, ensure you're logging into the correct Tray server as noted by the drop-down meu (Typically 'EU1' but there may be some exceptions as detailed below) and enter your email & password. Basic Navigation Upon initial login you'll be displayed the projects screen from the previous workspace you were in. You can change the workspace you're in from the drop-down menu in the top left. Within each workspace there will typically be three project folders. One for Authentication, one for testing/UAT and another for the live flows. Differences Between Tray Servers Whilst rare, there may be occasions where certain integrations may need to be set up on a different server than the default EU1 server. For example, the Shopify integration needed to be setup on the US server as the Shopify specific connectors weren't available in the EU1 server at the time of implementation. At present, the Shopify flows for The Courtauld Gallery are the only ones held in the US server. All other projects remain in the EU1 server. If projects are held outside of the EU1 section then this should be documented in the Customer-Specific Articles section of the KB. Useful Links/Documentation Tray has an extensive library of documentation that covers everything from a Quickstart guide to FAQ's and even an in-depth explanation of every individual connector. Tray Documentation can be accessed at https://tray.io/documentation/ or by clicking the 'Help Centre' button in the header and selecting the 'Documentation' option. More technical details can be found in the Developer Hub at https://developer.tray.io/ or in the Help Centre. The Tray Academy gives useful demos on different scenarios in Tray and explains how each different connector can be configured to function within a flow. Modules within the Tray academy can be revisited and completed again to refresh your knowledge. The Tray academy can also be accessed via the Help Centre or by navigating to https://academy.tray.io/. Customer Specific Details As tray will be used in a vastly different amount of implementations, more details on specific flows may be found in the Customer-Specific Articles section of the KB here https://support.k3btg.com/en/support/solutions/folders/103000495043.",
