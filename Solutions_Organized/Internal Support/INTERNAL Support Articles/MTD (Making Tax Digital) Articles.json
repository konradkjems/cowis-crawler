    "text": "No Data For Selected Dates 20 July 2022 14:38 There seems to be an issue in MTD where submission dates appear to attempt to submit for 1 year in the future. In the below example a user has tried to complete a submission for 1st April 2022 – 30th June 2022: The dates were correct when creating the submission however when they went to fetch the data for this submission period the dates were set a year in advance: This was remedied by attempting the submission in a different browser. You could also try clearing the cache or attempting the submission in incognito/private mode. N.B. clearing the cache should be done at the users discretion as this can clear useful information such as memorised logins, history, cookie preferences etc.",
