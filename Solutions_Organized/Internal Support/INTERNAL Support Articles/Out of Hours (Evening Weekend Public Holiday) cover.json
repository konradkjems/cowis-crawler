    "title": "What to do if someone calls out of hours and you're not sure if they are covered",
    "text": "TABLE OF CONTENTS If it IS a P1 If it's NOT a P1 What if they don't have cover? If you discover that the call is from a company who does not have cover If they insist they do have cover, and Freshdesk says not Exception for the UK Support Team Companies have the option to purchase support cover in the Evenings, Saturdays, Sundays/Public Holidays (one, all, or any combination of those 3 options). We do not offer out of hours support for some products like Cowis. If they do pay for this cover, it's only for P1s (unable to trade at a location/site/store) as per the Global Standard SLA. If it IS a P1 Either: Ask them to wait while you verify their details. You can then quickly look up their cover on the Company record. OR Log a ticket with the details of the issue and say you will investigate once you have verified their cover (then look up the cover after the call). If it's NOT a P1 Please politely tell them that the out of hours hotline is only for P1/can't trade issues (the hotline is actually always meant to be for only P1 issues!), and ask them to log their ticket via the portal (or email) and someone will look at it during normal Monday-Friday business days/hours. You can use your judgement on this, so for example, if this is a VIP customer with a P2, or any customer who has a till down, and there are not many other tills, then although it's a P2, it's fine to work on it as long as there are no P1s you should be working on first. What if they don't have cover? If you discover that the call is from a company who does not have cover You will need to call them back (if you've not still on the phone to them) and explain that they don't have the appropriate cover, and ask who we should contact at the company if they want a CSM to send them a quote for subscribing to out of hours cover. If they insist they do have cover, and Freshdesk says not You will have to tell the customer that you will help now because you can't verify with the CSM or Accounts team until the next working day, but if they don't have cover, they will be charged for the cost of helping them (which means they will have to sign up to the annual out of hours cover, or pay a high one-off fee with no further out of hours help). Exception for the UK Support Team The UK team are paid to be working full time out of hours, not just being on standby/reacting to P1s (which is the arrangement for the DK and NL teams). This means that the UK team should work on any other tickets during the out of hours shift, but priority should always be given to customers who are paying for out of hours cover who have a P1 (or exceptional P2). Therefore if a customer ever says in an evening or weekend/PH shift \"why won't you work on my P3 ticket I've raised today\", you can say that they are only paying for P1s to be worked on out of hours, but if there are no P1s, then we may work on other tickets in order of when their resolution is due in accordance with the SLA.",

    "text": "TABLE OF CONTENTS Overview Standby and Callout Standby (sometimes known as being \"on-call\") Callout (effectively the same as doing Overtime) Overtime Overview This article applies to the UK Retail Solutions team only because other countries have different schemes in place. Standby and Callout is for when you are available to be called for an emergency situation, and then claim for time spent dealing with that emergency. Overtime is for when your manager has approved for you to work more hours than your contracted standard working hours per day i.e. actively working, not being on standby for possibly working if called out Standby and Callout Standby (sometimes known as being \"on-call\") If on standby, you need to answer any phone calls made to you (which might be from another K3 team, or from a customer), and respond to any emergency Teams messages To be on Standby, you are entitled to have a company mobile phone allowance Team members do not need to be logged onto their computer unless they receive a phone call from FLS. You need to be able to logon to your laptop to deal with the issue within 15 minutes of a confirmed emergency call. You will be paid a fixed fee for standby availability (as of 2025, £10 per hour except £15/hour on Public Holidays). Hours claimed for standby should exclude your lunchbreak, and exclude any time you spend dealing with an emergency call which is claimed for separately. In the event that you are called by a customer, and it's not an emergency, you should ask the customer to log the details via email or portal, and explain that it will be dealt with the next working day. It is not expected that you will claim callout for this, but if it happens on a regular basis, then this can be reviewed. The number of people, days and times that you're on Standby can vary by team, and may change according to customer and business requirements. See Callout (effectively the same as doing Overtime) Callout work will be paid at 1.5x your normal hourly rate (or 2x on Public Holidays). These are the same rates as as Overtime You will need to keep a careful record of the time you spend on a confirmed emergency incident. Standby hours will not be claimed for the same period of time as claiming callout hours, ensuring no double payment. Team members must be able to work on the issue within 15 minutes of being called. Overtime Overtime is paid for active working outside of your normal hours (as opposed to standby which is being available for, but not actively working). Overtime must be pre-approved by your manager (e.g. time for fixes/upgrades that can't be done in trading hours). Email approval from your manager is best (or Teams message if it's really last-minute urgent). Occasionally it may not be possible to gain approval in advance which will be treated as an exception and the circumstances discussed with your manager. The MStore team are pre-approved to be paid overtime when they are on shift to: Work weekends and public holidays - the person on duty is paid to be working all day on tasks of all types and priorities (same as they would on a normal business hours working day) Regardless of their normal first or second line role, the person on duty should triage any new MStore tickets and respond to P1s as top priority in accordance to the customers paying for Extended Hours support. If a ticket is confirmed as a P1 hardware ticket, they should call one of the hardware team who are on standby during Extended Hours Overtime will be paid at 1.5x your normal hourly rate (or 2x on Public Holidays).",
