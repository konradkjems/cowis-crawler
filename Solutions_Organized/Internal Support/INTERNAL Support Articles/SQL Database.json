    "text": "Corrupt Master Log 30 March 2023 13:32 While restarting the MS SQL service you will get an error and MS SQL service on the server won't start . If you check the event viewer in Windows you may find a similar error to the below. The log scan number passed to log scan in database master is not valid. This error may indicate data corruption or that the log file (.ldf) does not match the data file (.mdf). If this error occurred during replication, re-create the publication. Otherwise, restore from backup if the problem results in a failure during startup. This usually occurs when the master.mdf or the mastlog.ldf gets corrupt . Best practice in this case would be to restore from backup. However it is not always the case that the master database is backed up. In order to solve the issue we have two options ; Using Setup to Recreate System Databases Open an elevated command prompt and from the bootstrap directory- \"C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft SQL Server\\\\Setup Bootstrap\\\" (replace with the right version and with the right release SQL Version Cheat Sheet may help you identify which version you need) run the following command substituting your SQL instance name, a windows account to have administrative rights and a secure password for SA where indicated. Before running this make sure you have copies of the existing model and msdb databases saved off somewhere safe! .\\setup /ACTION=REBUILDDATABASE /INSTANCENAME= /SQLSYSADMINACCOUNTS= /SAPWD= All being well this we recreate the master db with the details provided in the command. You should then replace the model and msdb files with the good ones you moved previously. The MS SQL service should then start. NOTE : You may be required to reattach the existing databases to the instance depending on what was lost when the master db corrupted. If the above fails then there is another method but it has pitfalls. Manually Recreating the Master Database The below method will work however it will remove all users from the instance making logging in and administration very difficult. This method should be used as a last ditch effort to get the system up and running. It may be preferable to reinstall SQL completely over the below. Before running this make sure you have copies of the existing model and msdb databases saved off somewhere safe! Navigate to your instance folder \"C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft SQL Server\\MSSQL.1\\MSSQL \" , there you will find a folder called Template Data, copy the master.mdf and mastlog.ldf from Template Data and replace it in \"C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft SQL Server\\MSSQL.1\\MSSQL\\Data\" NOTE : You WILL be required to reattach the existing databases to the instance.

    "title": "Database (Suspect) Mode",
    "text": "Database (Suspect) Mode 29. marts 2023 16:59 If a database is showing as suspect in SSMS this usually means there is an integrity issue between with data file (mdf) and the log file (ldf). Sometimes however it can be a red herring. Before attempting the below it is worth a restart of the SQL service to see if the database will come back online. If that doesn't work then it is best practice to restore from the last good backup. If a backup isn't available and the database does not recover after a restart then the below procedure should be attempted. Step 1: Put the database in EMERGENCY mode Change the database status to EMERGENCY mode. Doing so, will provide users read-only access to the database. The basic purpose of changing the database mode to emergency is troubleshooting what resulted in database suspect mode issue. To change the database status to EMERGENCY mode, run the below T-SQL query: ALTER DATABASE dbName SET EMERGENCY (dbName could be POS or POS CONFIG) Once you have changed the database status, you will be able to access the db. Step 2: Check database integrity Next, execute Database Console Command (DBCC) CHECKDB. The command helps check the logical and physical integrity of the specified database. If it finds any problem with the database, it recommends appropriate repair options such as ‘REPAIR_REBUILD’, ‘REPAIR_FAST’, or ‘REPAIR_ALLOW_DATA_LOSS’. Use the following query to run DBCC CHECKDB: DBCC CHECKDB ('dbName') (dbName could be POS or POS CONFIG, depending on which one is in Suspect mode) Suggestion: Make sure to run the DBCC CHECKDB command regularly to check for physical and logical integrity of the database. Step 3: Set database in SINGLE_USER mode Now run the below T-SQL query to rollback any transaction and bring the SQL database to Single User mode. ALTER DATABASE dbName SET SINGLE_USER WITH ROLLBACK IMMEDIATE Step 4: Repair the database Re-Run DBCC CHECKDB with repair options to repair the suspect database. For this, use the following T-SQL query: DBCC CHECKDB (dbname, REPAIR) WITH NO_INFOMSGS; IF REPAIR alone still produces errors use DBCC CHECKDB (dbname, REPAIR_ALLOW_DATA_LOSS) WITH NO_INFOMSGS Note: DBCC CHECKDB with REPAIR_ALLOW_DATA_LOSS may help you fix all the errors and repair them; however, it can cause data loss from the repaired database. Step 5: Bring the database to MULTI_USER mode If you find that the script runs successfully, bring the database back from single-user mode to multi-user mode. Run the following command to do it: ALTER DATABASE dbName SET MULTI_USER Step 6: Bring the database ONLINE To change the database state from EMERGENCY to ONLINE, execute the following command: ALTER DATABASE dbName SET ONLINE Once repaired and back online immediately backup the database and suggest potential backup solutions to recover from potential future incidents.

    "text": "Timestamp in MS SQL vrijdag 23 september 2022 10:53 Timestamp in MS SQL Question from a web builder from one of our customers Do you know what the timestamp of September 1, 2022 is? The question was: I would like to run an import from September 1st, but I don't know exactly how to set up the timestamp. What I see in the code is that we take over the timestamp and compare it with the Timestamp field of a contact from your system. For example, a timestamp of today is 9532942. Could you tell me what that is from September 1, 2022 0:00? Answer: We have had this question before and unfortunately a Timestamp is not as the name suggests an equivalent of a date and time. See also explanation below. There are various forums where this is explained, but you just have to see the code as a kind of tracking number. As soon as an UPDATE is performed on a record, a trigger is called that updates RecModified to the current system date (from where the database is running) The RecTimeStamp will also be adjusted. Incidentally, in the forums you can also read that in MS SQl TimeStamp is marked as depricated. In other words, marked as no longer usable, because it will (possibly) be removed. TIMESTAMP in SQL This datatype is also known as \"rowversion\", and the original name is really unfortunate. A timestamp column is automatically updated whenever a row is updated, and the value is monotonically increasing in the database. There is absolutely no relation to date and time. The main purpose of timestamp is to implement optimistic concurrency. The client reads a row from the database gets the timestamp value from the database and sends it back on UPDATE. The UPDATE operation includes a condition on timestamp in the WHERE clause, and if the timestamp value has changed since the client read the value, the update is not performed - and the update that came in-between is not lost. timestamp/rowversion does not seem to be that popular these days, but I have worked with a system where have many of these columns for exactly this reason. Because it is monotonically increasing, some people also use it to find the most recently changed rows in a table, but this is not what it is designed for, and it does not work well in high-concurrency environment. SQL Server offers better features for this purpose, for instance Change Tracking. Example: Customer 111903 LastChanged: 01-12-2016 has Timestamp 0x0000000000255C0F Converted to a date with https://www.epochconverter.com/: 29-01-1970 If we change this customer, the new Timestamp will be: 0x00000000007D80F2 Converted to date: 06-04-1970 So there's not really a logic to it. Therefore, we cannot specify what the Timestamp is on a certain date.",

SQL Server offers better features for this purpose, for instance Change Tracking.</em></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Example:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Customer 111903 LastChanged: 01-12-2016 has Timestamp &nbsp;0x0000000000255C0F</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://s3-eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/euc-cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/103031501860/original/JuUOFwnXRMFS__3rnE7ghxFfN7EzP9Rc9w.jpeg?1687364670\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dii\" data-attachment=\"[object Object]\" data-id=\"103031501860\" width=\"518\"></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;Converted to a date with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.epochconverter.com/\">https://www.epochconverter.com/</a>: 29-01-1970</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://s3-eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/euc-cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/103031501861/original/cvgCIigHJRbWuNeYpjThYlQYn_qQzGT4Nw.jpeg?1687364670\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dii\" data-attachment=\"[object Object]\" data-id=\"103031501861\" width=\"519\"></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If we change this customer, the new Timestamp will be: 0x00000000007D80F2</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://s3-eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/euc-cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/103031501862/original/Rq_0685UjbNnEIsA64MHeE_iC4U5HkS1uA.jpeg?1687364670\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dii\" data-attachment=\"[object Object]\" data-id=\"103031501862\" width=\"528\"></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Converted to date: 06-04-1970</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://s3-eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/euc-cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/103031501863/original/iSdkhnKH5WE5mhqMkwEuAa3Zbh1lp-qM5w.jpeg?1687364670\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dii\" data-attachment=\"[object Object]\" data-id=\"103031501863\" width=\"539\"></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So there's not really a logic to it.</p><p>Therefore, we cannot specify what the Timestamp is on a certain date.</p>",

    "text": "Understanding SQL locks vrijdag 23 september 2022 10:59 Locking Locking is the situation where a table is exclusively locked for 1 session to do an update or delete. Others will have to wait if they want to update or delete on the same table. Mr Blue updates some data, therefor locks the table so he has exclusive access. Mrs Green does the same, but instead on a different table. Both are not experiencing any performance loss or other problems. Blocking Blocking is the situation where a table is exclusively locked for 1 session to do an update or delete. Others are waiting for the first session to finish before they can update or delete on that same table. Mr Blue updates some data, therefor locks table A so he has exclusive access. Mrs Green also wants to update Table A, but she has to wait for Mr Blue to finish. And she will wait forever, until Mr Blue is finished. This can result in Mrs Green experiencing loss of performance loss. Applications usually have some kind of timeout, so it is to be expected that when this all takes too long, a timeout error will occur. Deadlocking Deadlocking is the situation where 2 or more sessions are running updates or deletes on multiple tables and are waiting for each other to finish work on a table they need access to, so they can finish their work. Mr Blue started a session where he will be updating Table A and later on he also needs to update Table B. In the mean time Mrs Green started a session where she is updating Table B. And she also needs to do an update on Table A in that same session. Mr Blue holds the lock on Table A, while he waits for Mrs Green to finish work on Table B. Mrs Green holds the lock on Table B, while she waits for Mr Blue to finish work on Table A. This has now turned into a Mexican standoff that they can’t figure out themselves. Now SQL Server steps in and makes a decision and simply kills one of the two sessions and all changes in that session will be rollbacked. SQL Server will base the decision on what he thinks is simplest for him to rollback. This can result in some feelings of bad performance, as SQL Server can take up to 5 seconds before making the decision to kill a deadlock situation. But more important: The session that was killed and rolled back has lost its data! It’s up to the process performing the query (probably an application) to retry the query. Although this sounds simple, most of the time this does not happen and data is lost forever. WITH (NOLOCK) In order not to have a problem with locking, we often see the use of the WITH (NOLOCK) query option to bypass locking and speeding up performance when running SELECT statements. However, using this option, you will also see data that SQL Server is still processing. You are likely to get results back that are being changed as you run the query. Your query is returning ‘dirty’ results. And when accuracy is needed, these results can be disastrously off! Both these selects get the same results when there are no updates running. But watch what happens if we start a second session where updates are being done to the same table but different records. Note: The SELECT statements looks for all users with DisplayName is ‘alex’. The UPDATE statement explicitly updates all records where DisplayName does not equals ‘alex’. From the results of the SELECT statement you can clearly see they are constantly changing, although that data is not being changed! If we would depend on the numbers of this query being accurate, we will fail big time. But using WITH (NOLOCK) can be useful when accuracy is not an issue. For example, if we would query a queue. If we see the queue length rising, this is an indication that we must act for example to check if there isn’t an application down. In this case, it doesn’t really matter that our numbers are correct. Continuous monitoring is what counts here.",
