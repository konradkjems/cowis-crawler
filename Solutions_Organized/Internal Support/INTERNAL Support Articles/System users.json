    "text": "Here is how to add a new user to Back Office or change an existing user in BO. Log into Backoffice with a user with administrator rights Click on Maintenance Click on System users To change/update a user, select the user by clicking on the name, edit what needs to be edited and click ok to accept the changes. If the user is not setup correctly (i.e. needs to have access to certain things like gift/credit vouchers), you may need to delete the user and set them up again, this time based on a user that has the access they need. Take a screenshot of the setup, since you will need to set it up exactly the way it looks now. E.g. User number (will be reused), User name (should be exactly the same as before), Password (should be the same as before), whether there is a tick in Master, whether they have access to DdDadmin* and whether they have a clerk number. Remember!!! You cannot delete the user you are logged in with. If the user login you want to change is the one you are logged in with, you will need to find a different user with the same rights in order to delete that user. First open the user as above and click delete. Again, remember to make a note of the setup, if you just want to recreate the user because something was missing. Observe that you are logged in as user1, but want to delete user3. The user is now gone. Click Create System User Fill in the right details (if you are recreating the user you just deleted): Pay attention to that you base the recreated user on a user who has the rights this user should have. Click create. The user has now been recreated and can log in again, this time with the correct access.",
