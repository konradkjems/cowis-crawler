    "title": "PEDInESDRecoveryMode When Taking Card Payment On MStore Till",
    "text": "If you are using the VeriFone Ocius Sentinel integration with our MStore till, and you receive the PEDInESDRecoveryMode message on the till during a card payment, this is due to the card machine having a feature that detects static and will shut the card machine down to protect itself. This can be caused due to the card machine being in damp environments, on metal surfaces and/or close to other electronic devices, like detaggers and hearing loops. The short-term fix for this would be to unplug the card machine ONLY from the power source, wait 10 seconds, and then plugging it back in. Once you have done this, restart the till, where card payments should begin working again once the till has logged back in again. If this does not resolve the issue please do get in contact with our support team to help further with this. Long-term prevention steps that can be taken by avoiding damp environments, metal surfaces and other electronic devices touching or being close to the card machine. You can also use anti-static clothes to wipe down surfaces in contact with the card machine, or cleaning cards for card machines can remove static.",
