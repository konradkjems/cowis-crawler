A simple example would be to have departments of ‘Admissions’, ‘Hospitality’ and ‘Retail’ to monitor transactions and cash flow the tills in these areas ('Departments') of the business. Another benefit of setting up different 'Departments' is that it gives greater control over the information 'Users' can access in the MStore back office software. Users can be setup so that they are restricted to only see and update information in MStore for the 'Department' they are assigned to. N.B. setting up new 'Users' must be carried out after setting up the required 'Security Groups', both of which are covered in this guide in the relevant sections. Editing Departments Departments are setup by first clicking 1. ‘Setup’ icon, then 2. click 'System' then 3. double click ‘Departments’ icon. You will now see a 'Departments' screen like the on below. For brand new customers there are typically three 'Departments' already set up for you; these are ‘Admissions’, ‘Retail’ and ‘Hospitality’. However for existing customers there will be all the various Departments and Sub-Departments showing that have been set up by your colleagues in MStore. But the process of adding / editing theses is the same and is detailed below. To edit one of the existing 'Departments', click on it so that it becomes highlighted. Each 'Department' is made up of a 'Code' (10 characters maximum) and a 'Description' (30 characters maximum), which can be seen in the ‘Department Details’ section of this screen. To amend either the 'Code' or 'Description' of an existing 'Department', click in the relevant box. Change this information to be as required and then click the ‘Save’ button. Adding a New Department To create a new department, click the ‘New’ icon Type in the required 'Code' and 'Description' for this 'Department'. Next click on the ‘Save’ button and the new 'Department' will be added. Repeat as required to create all the 'Departments' you need. Sub Departments Introduction 'Sub-Departments' can provide another level of reporting below each 'Department'. N.B. you must set up at least one Sub-Department for each Department you have created (as when tills are set up in a separate process then each till is mapped to a 'Sub-Department' for reporting purposes. When tills are created If you do not require any additional breakdown at the 'Sub-Department' level, you would simply create a 'Sub-Department' with the same 'Code' and 'Description' as the 'Department' it belongs to. Adding and Editing Sub Departments For new customers default, three 'Sub-Departments' exist ‘out of the box’, one to mirror each of the default 'Departments'. You can see which are 'Sub-Departments' as these are the ones with and entry showing in the 'Sub-Dept' column. To edit an existing 'Sub-Department' click on it so that it becomes highlighted. Just like a 'Department', a 'Sub-Department' also has a 'Code' (max 10 characters) and a 'Description' (max 30 characters). The only difference to setting up a 'Department' is that to create a 'Sub-Department' you must select a ‘Parent Dept’ using the relevant drop-own menu. The 'Parent Dept' you select determines which 'Department' this 'Sub-Department' belongs to. Amend the 'Code' and 'Description' by typing in the correct details and if required amend the 'Parent Dept' by picking it from the relevant drop-down menu. Click on the ‘Save’ button to accept the changes. Alternatively, you may need to add 'Sub-Departments' to give you the required granularity for reporting purposes. In the 'Department' of ‘Admissions’ you may have tills that are in two distinct areas need that you need to get a split between, e.g. the ‘North Gate’ and ‘South Gate’ admissions. So these might be examples of 'Sub-Departments' that you need to set up. To add a new 'Sub-Department', click on the ‘New’button. Enter the code and description for the 'Sub-Department' as required. As a 'Sub-Department' must belong to a 'Department', you need to select the name of the 'Department' it belongs to using the ‘Parent Dept’ (Parent Department) drop-down menu. Once you have entered the required information, click on the ‘Save’ button. Repeat as required to create all the required 'Sub-Departments'. This will allow you to be able to filter specific sales reports in Mstore by a 'specific Department' or 'Sub Department' to produce reports on sales for different till groupings as required. Security Groups- Introduction 'Security Groups' control the level of access given to Users that are assigned to that 'Security Group'. This not only means that Users are restricted on what they can and cannot do, they can also be restricted to seeing only information for a specific 'Department' or 'Sub-Department' (such as running reports only for a specific 'Department' and 'Sub Department' only). This enables Users of the MStore back office software to have only the buttons and functionality they require, as defined by the Security Group they are assigned to. Editing Security Groups The creation and management of Security Groups in MStore is done from the ‘Security Groups’ screen. This can be found by clicking on 1. the ‘Setup’ icon, then 2. click ‘Security’ icon, then 3. double click 'Security Groups' The 'Security Groups' screen is a very simple and easy to use screen. There are two main parts of the screen which you need to pay attention to, the first being the ‘Security Group’ drop-down. Use this drop-down to select the Security Group you wish to review or update. The second part of the screen is the ‘Permissions’ window, this is where you can select what you want this ‘Security Group’ to have access to (i.e. the permissions for the ‘Security Group’). You will notice several small + icons to the left of some of the permissions. This shows that there are more access rights within that permission and can be revealed by clicking on the +. Click on the + and the sub-menu of permissions will now be displayed You will notice that the + symbol you clicked on has now change to a – symbol. You will notice a new sub-menu will be displayed (potentially with more permissions with + icons next to them, indicating there are additional sub menus to be displayed). Once you have found the relevant permission it can be changed by either: (i) right clicking on the permission you want to change. (ii) left clicking on the permission and pressing the space bar on your keyboard. You will notice that the tick either changes from a green tick to a red cross (indicating the permission is removed), or from a red cross to a green tick (indicating the permission is granted). Please note that changing the permissions in a ‘Security Group’ will affect all the Users that are in that ‘Security Group’. Once you have made the required changes to all the required permissions within a ‘Security Group,’ click on the ‘Apply’ button to accept the changes. You can then pick the next ‘Security Group’ from the drop-down list and repeat the process until all permissions are set as required for each ‘Security Group’. Adding Security Groups To add a new ‘Security Group’, click on the ‘New’ icon. The ‘New Security Group’ window is loaded, as shown below. You must enter a 'Code' for this ‘Security Group’ (maximum 3 characters). Next enter a 'Description' for this ‘Security Group’ (maximum 25 characters). Click the ‘OK’ button to accept these changes. Alternatively click the ‘Cancel’ button at this point to exit and lose all changes. In most the other fields can be left blank these would only be used for the few customers that have purchased card printers and are printing their own clerk login cards. For more information and a quote if required, please contact your Customer Success Account manager. Your new ‘Security Group’ has now been created and added to the list. You will notice that each ‘Security Group’ is created with no access rights at all. Please note you must add all the required access rights for each ‘Security Group’ you create. Once all the required permissions have been set for this ‘Security Group’, click ‘Apply’ button to accept these changes. Removing Security Groups In the event of needing to remove a ‘Security Group’, first select the one you wish to delete using the drop-down menu. N.B. this should only ever be done if you have first re-assigned all users in this Security Group to an alternative one. With the required ‘Security Group’ selected, next click on the ‘Delete’ button. You will be asked to confirm that you want to delete the Security Group. Upon clicking the ‘Yes’ button, the Security Group is deleted. Upon clicking the ‘Yes’ button, the 'Security Group' is deleted permanently. Once the required changes to your Security Groups have been made, click on the ‘Close’ button to exit this screen. Users - Introduction The ability to create and manage 'Users' can be found in the following location. Click on 1. the ‘Setup’ icon, followed by 2. the ‘Security’ icon and then 3. double click on the ‘Users’ icon. This screen is divided into two main sections. 1. 'User List': This shows all 'Users' setup and a summary of their details. 2. 'Employee Details': this shows all information for the selected employee. Adding New Users To add a new user, click on the ‘New’ icon. The employee details section is now clear, you can input the details of your new user. ‘Security Group’ is the first option you must select when adding a user. To do this you must first click on the ‘Change’ button. You will now see the following screen. Click on the required 'Security Group' for this 'User' (e.g. ‘System Administrators’). Next click the ‘OK’ button. ‘Computer User Name’ is the next box you must fill in. This is the username the user will need to type in to log in to the MStore back office software. This can be up to a maximum of 25 characters which can include both letters and numbers. If you do not have any current convention for usernames, then you we recommend just entering e.g. a username based on the person’s initials. ‘Swipe Card Number’ is only entered if you have purchased swipe cards for logging onto the till. If this user is to log on to the till using a \"swipe card\" then enter employee’s swipe card number here (this number should be printed on the cards you were supplied by your preferred card printer / supplier). These could either be magnetic stripe cards or barcoded cards that are used for till login purposes, for more details contact your Customer Success Account Manager for details of and a quote for the hardware requirements, as depending on the card type purchased you will need either scanners or magnetic swipe card readers to have been installed by K3 on your tills. If you will not use \"swipe\" cards to login to the till this value is left at 0 in this field. ‘Full Name’ section is where you enter the name for this user. To enter the required information, you must 1. click on the ‘Full Name’ button. 2. Enter the other information as required: If required, select a ‘Title’ using the drop-down menu (e.g. 'Mr') Enter the required ‘Forenames’ and ‘Surname’ in the relevant boxes. If required, select a ‘select a ‘Suffix’ using the drop-down menu (e.g. 'MBE'). 3. Click the ‘OK’ button once all the required information has been entered. To enter the address details, 1. click on the ‘Address’ button. 2. Enter the ‘House + Street’, ‘Town/City’, ‘County’ and ‘Post Code’ and 'Email' address details as required. Please note if you have purchased the post code look up software integration for the back office software, then you can type in the post code then click 'Search'. The list of addresses returned for this postcode will be shown as a dropdown, from which to select the correct address to populate the address fields automatically. If you do not have the post code look up integration and want to find out more and get a quote, please Customer Success Account Manager. The 'Our Reference' and 'Delivery FAO' are only necessary for 'Users' that will create 'Purchase Orders' in MStore, which is covered in a separate manual, so these can be entered if required. Likewise if you want to enter any notes about this 'User' then these can also be entered as required (e.g. \"Part time Monday and Thursday shifts only\") in the 'Notes' field. 3. Click the ‘OK’ button to accept these changes. ‘Max P/O Auth Amount’ is only required if this user will use the Mstore 'Purchase Orders' system to raise purchase orders. This is the maximum Purchase Order value that this 'User' can authorise, so enter the amount as required. If this user will not be raising any Purchase Order in MStore this can be left at 0.00. As explained previously the MStore 'Purchased Order' functionality is covered in another user guide an dis outside the scope of this manual. The 'Department' and 'Sub-Department' drop-downs are used to specify which 'Department' that user belongs to. This can be setup so that the user can only view information in MStore for their 'Department'. Use the drop-down menu to pick the required 'Department' and 'Sub-Department' for this user. It is now also possible to assign employees to an 'Outlet' (y an additional dropdown selector above the 'Department' selector, but this is only for customers that need and have set up 'Outlets'. This is useful for organisations that want to restrict and report at different levels over and above department. 'Outlets' would first need to be set up (in Setup > System> Outlets). Then 'Sub Departments' can be assigned to an 'Outlet' to define which tills make up an 'Outlet' for reporting purposes. Then by allocating 'Users' to an 'Outlet' this will those users are then only able to view information and reports for the 'Outlet' they have been assigned to in the above screen. Please note if you do nit have this functionality then you will require a back office software upgrade, so please contact your Customer Success Account Manager. The contact details section can be filled in simply by clicking in each field and entering the details as required. Enter the required ‘Home Telephone’, ‘Work Telephone’, ‘Mobile Telephone’, 'Car Reg:' and ‘E-mail’ details as required. ‘Notes’ is a text box that can be filled in with any information that might be useful about that user. If the 'Notes' box is not big enough, then click on the button (to the right of the Notes box). This will open a new window with a larger text box. This can be used to enter more detailed notes about this user. Once you have finished entering the required notes click the ‘OK’ button. Click on the ‘Save’ button and the new user will be created. Once a new user has been created, you must setup their new 'Password' and 'PIN'. By default the Password entered for this user will be required for them to login to the MStore back office software. The user will login to MStore by entering both their 'Computer User Name' and the 'Password' you enter for this user. The 'PIN' will be used for the user to login to the till. To set the 'Password', click on the ‘Change’ button. Type the new password in the ‘New Password’ box. Next you must retype the password in the ‘Confirm Password’ box. Click the ‘OK’ button. A warning is now displayed advising that the password change is not instant. Click on the ‘OK’ button to continue. The 'PIN' is the number a user enters to log onto a till. To set the PIN, click on the ‘Change’ button. Type the required PIN in the ‘New PIN’ box. Next you must retype the PIN in the ‘Confirm PIN’ box. A warning is now displayed advising that the PIN change is not instant. Click on the ‘OK’ button to continue. Once all the required data has been entered click the ‘Save’ button. Please note: you need to use the ‘Recreate Till Data’ option (in Edit > Recreate Till Data) to send any changes to your tills. Please remember to do this once you have finished adding / editing all 'Users' Editing Users Updating 'User' information in MStore is very straightforward and similar to the process of adding a 'User'. Select the user from the list at the top of the window, click in and update the field(s) that needs updating and click the ‘Save’ button. Please note you need to use the ‘Recreate Till Data’ option (in File > Recreate Till Data) in the usual way, to send these changes to your tills. Deactivating/Reactivating Users A 'User' can be deactivated and reactivated as required. This has the advantage that a user can be reactivated at a later date if required. To make a user inactive first: 1. Click on the user so they are highlighted yellow. 2. Click on the ‘Inactive’ box, so that it becomes ticked. 3. Finally click on the ‘Save’ button to accept this change. If you need to reactivate a user you will have to: 1. click on the ‘Show Inactive’ box, so it is ticked. N.B. an inactive user is displayed with a line through their user name. 2. Then click on the user to select them. 3. Click the ‘Inactive’ box, so it becomes un-ticked. 4. Finally click on the ‘Save’ button to accept this change. Please note you need to use the ‘Recreate Till Data’ option (in File > Recreate Till Data) in the usual way, to send these changes to your tills.",

This document is aimed at our customers that want to submit gift-aid claims directly from MStore to the online HMRC portal by using our 'Gift Aid Management' module. Please note that the 'Gift Aid Management' module is not installed by default. For all those with MStore users that need to run and submit gift aid claims directly to the HMRC, they will need the 'Gift Aid Management' module installing on their computer. If you have already purchased and are using the 'Gift Aid Management' module then you will already have been supplied the installation files and instructions that your own internal IT team or external IT support provider need to install. For customers who do not have this module already, as this module requires background installation, set up and training, please contact your Customer Success Account manager for more information and a quote. Security Group Settings For all MStore 'Users' that need access to the 'Gift Aid Management' module there are specific settings need to be applied to all the 'Security Groups' that need access to this module. Please ask the colleagues in your organisation that manage MStore 'Security Groups' to apply the settings detailed below. A separate guide covers setting up 'Security Groups' but in brief this is done as below in Setup > Security > Security Groups. 1. Select the first 'Security Group' that needs access to view / submit Gift Aid claims. 2. Click the + symbol to the left of the 'Allow Access to BOS Setup' (it will change to a - symbol, as shown below). 3. Scroll down to and click the + symbol to the left of the the 'Gift Aid Management' options (and it changes to a - symbol). 4. Right click on the settings as required so they are ticked, to allow access to view and submit gift aid claim data as required. (please note if you accidentally turned and option on or off then right click it again to change this back as required) 5. Click 'Apply'. Repeat as required for each of your 'Security Groups' that need access to viewing/submitting Gift Aid claims. N.B. 'Users' need to log out than back into MStore for these settings to apply. Please note these settings alone will not make the 'Gift Aid Malmanagement' module work. This module will only work if the required background installation and configuration work has been carried has also been carried out. If you require more information and a quote for the set up and training then please contact your Customer Success Account manager. Launching the Gift Aid Manager Login to MStore. Click on 1. 'Setup' then click 2. Customer then 3. Double-click on the ‘Gift Aid Management’ icon User Interface Overview 1. Gift Aid 'Charity Selector' (only used if you have multiple charities that you separately submit gift aid claims for ) 2. Search Options 3. Number of search results 4. Number of invalid postcodes (in these search results) 5. Grid displaying gift aid claims 6. Claim totals and tax rate 7. Calculated 'Amount to Claim' Settings Charity Details Before you can submit a claim for the first time, you will need need to contact the HMRC and obtain the required information concerning your HMRC account then enter these 'Charity Details' in MStore. Please note K3 cannot advise on obtain these details for you, or advise if they are correct, the HMRC would need to provide this information. If these details are entered incorrectly in MStore then the submission will fail with a validation error, which is covered later in this guide.. To enter the details provided by the HMRC, click the ‘Charity Details’ button, in the bottom-right corner of the above screen, Next click the 'New' button. Enter the account information provided by the HMRC. Please note for security if you don't want the password to be stored, click the 'Prompt for password each submission' box, so it is ticked. You then cannot enter a password and will have to enter this each time you generate a submission Click 'Ok'. You will see the below, click 'Yes'. Repeat as required if you have more than one charity for HMRC gift aid submissions. Data Security All of these details are contained in every gift-aid submission and are stored in our database. The HMRC Gateway password is stored encrypted. Searching for Claims The options you can use to filter search results as shown below are detailed in this section. Unclaimed Entries/Claimed Entries/All Entries This filters results based on whether they have been submitted to the Inland Revenue. The software will not allow you to perform a submission if it includes any claims marked as previously submitted. Customer’s Details Forename Initial: The first character of the customer’s forename. Surname: The customer’s surname. Postcode: The customer’s postcode. It does not matter whether a space is present. Analysis Code This filter results to only transactions which sold an item from this 'Analysis Code'. Date Range Date of last claim: This is the date on which you last performed a gift aid submission. Declarations From: The date from which gift aided transactions should be included. Declarations To: The date up to, and including, which gift aided transactions should be included. Branch Most MStore customers will not require and use the 'Branch' so this filter can be ignored inmost cases. For any customers that have been advised to and use this, then the required 'Branch' can be selected. Department / Sub-Department By default, all departments are included, however you can also filter results by which MStore 'Department' and 'Sub-Department' processed the transaction. Search When you click the ‘Search’ button, the program performs several functions: 1. Retrieves all of the gift aided transactions matching the above criteria. 2. Analyses each of the Postcodes to check whether they match the expected format. Any which do not match the expected format are marked as ‘No’ in the ‘Postcode OK’ column. 3. Formats addresses so that they are presented in a consistent format. 4. Calculates the total claim value. Please note you can also use the column headings to order data as this may help trouble shooting invalid data. For example if the search showed '1 invalid postcode' you can then click on e.g. the 'Postcode OK' column and it will sort data by this column. You can click on the column again to toggle the sort order as required. In this case is was toggles so that the 'No' entries showed at the top of the list. Any column can be ordered this way to assist checking and amending data as required. Gift Aid Claims Table This grid presents the retrieved gift aid claims after the ‘Search’ function has formatted them. The claims can be sorted by each column, by clicking on the column headers. This is especially useful when editing invalid postcodes, as you sort by whether the Postcodes are OK and see at once all of the records that require editing. The ‘Postcode OK’ column has a particular purpose: All claims must now have postcodes that match a valid postcode format. Please note - all claims must either have a valid postcode or be deleted. Please note that HMRC have specified a maximum length for the Forename and Surname of thirty-five characters each, and a maximum length of forty characters for the entire address (not including the postcode). Characters beyond this limit will either be truncated when saving, or that field will not be saved. Editing a Claim’s Details The ‘Forename’, ‘Surname’, ‘Address’ and ‘Postcode’ fields can be edited. The ‘Date’, ‘Date Claimed’, ‘Value (£)’ and ‘Postcode OK’ fields cannot be edited. To edit a claim’s details, simply double-click on the details you wish to edit and change them as required. In this example an invalid post code was entered and is edited as required. Changes are not saved until you either click on the ‘OK’ or ‘Apply’ buttons. However, please note clicking ‘Apply’ will prompt to save the changes but leaves the 'Gift Aid Submission' screen open. Clicking ‘Ok' will prompt to save the changes but then will close the 'Gift Aid Submission' screen. Please note after changes are saved if you made any errors, then you will then edit the data again to make any corrections. Deleting a Claim A claim may require deletion if the Postcode is invalid and cannot be corrected, or if the customer has asked for their claim to be cancelled. To delete a claim, select the claim and either: a. Press the ‘Delete’ key on your keyboard, or b. Right-click on the claim and select the ‘Delete’ option. The changes are not saved until you either click on the ‘OK’ or ‘Apply’ buttons. Again ‘Apply’ will save but leave the screen open, whereas ‘OK’ will save and close the screen. Please note, after changes are saved, they cannot be automatically undone. This is particularly important to remember when deleting a claim as undoing the deletion requires you to add the claim manually, requiring you to know the customer’s details and the transaction number. Adding a New Claim To add a new gift aid claim, click on the ‘Add New Gift Aid Transaction’ button and fill in all of the fields. The ‘Receipt Code’ must be filled in and match the transaction’s receipt code, as a gift aid claim must be linked to a transaction record. You are also required to fill in at least the customer’s ‘Forename’, ‘Surname’, house name/number (in e.g. ‘Address Line 1’). and ‘Postcode’. Click 'Ok' once the required data has been entered into this form (or 'Cancel' to exit this screen) Please note if you do not enter a valid MStore till and transaction number, the following message will show. You will not be able to proceed and add the gift aid claim unless a valid till / transaction number is entered. Click 'Ok' and you are returned to the 'Add New Gift Aid Transaction' form. Please note if you enter an MStore till and transaction number where there is already a gift aid claim entry, then the following message will show. You cannot add a transaction unless it is for a transaction where there is no claim already present. In this scenario the system will not let you add this submission. Click 'Ok' and you are returned to the 'Add New Gift Aid Transaction' form. If you entered a valid till transaction that does not already have a gift aid claim entry, the below will show, Click 'Yes' and this added transaction will now be visible in the relevant claim searches. Claimable Value and Tax Rate These figures do not form part of the submission; they are just used to inform you of the amount you are claiming. The basic rate of Income Tax is set by default to 20%. This can be changed, and the change will then be reflected in the claim amount. Export to Excel If Microsoft Excel has been installed on the computer by you own IT team or IT support provider, then clicking on the ‘Export to Excel’ button will open an Excel worksheet containing the contents of the gift aid claims grid. Submitting a Claim To submit a claim, click on the ‘Submit Claim to HMRC’ button. This will submit a claim to the HMRC of all of the gift aid claims in the grid. A submission will only be made if: 1. All postcodes are valid, and 2. None of the claims are marked as previously submitted If you have not marked your historical gift aid claims as submitted, do not resubmit any of these claims as you cannot simply edit / cancel them using the HMRC portal! Instead you must contact HMRC to resolve this. Please Note: Zero-value submissions are not accepted by HMRC: Although they are presented in the grid and marked as submitted when appropriate, this is just for your reference and they are not actually sent. Negative-value claims cannot be sent individually: instead, the value is totalled, and they are sent as an adjustment to current claim’s value. Submission Response The submission is divided into batches of 1,000 records: This so that if you have a slow internet connection you will not time-out when submitting records. Each batch is sent in turn to the HMRC portal, and then the software waits for a response stating whether each submission was successful. Marking Claims as Submitted If the submission was successful, each claim is immediately and automatically marked as submitted. Whether it was successful or not, you can view the message sent from the HMRC for the last batch by clicking the ‘View Details’ button. Submission Errors In the above instance this will open the error received from the HMRC in a web browser: Although the error report looks complex, the only important point is the cause of the error, circled above. In this case the charity details are not valid. All submission files are saved in the computer’s common application data folder. This is located in: C:\\ProgramData\\Merac\\Gift Aid\\ The files display their type (submission request or response) and the date. Note: The HMRC reference, 'irMark', cannot be added to the filename as it uses special characters that Windows will not allow as part of a filename. It must be found in each file by searching for ‘irMark’. They are not saved anywhere else, so please backup this folder if you require an audit trail: Customers have reported that HMRC have no gift-aid reporting tools! Adjustments to Previous Gift Aid Claims Occasionally you may need to adjust a previous submission, for example when a customer tells you that they are unable to gift aid, but you have already submitted their claim. As transactions are batched before sending to HMRC and the overall claim value must be positive for each batch, the maximum negative adjustment should not be more than £1,000 without contacting us first. We have looked for a method to make this very easy for you but have been unable to find such a method that leaves an audit trail and does not affect your Transaction / Cashup reports. As such, the process to create a gift aid adjustment is to sell a gift aided item, then refund that item but non-gift aided. Detailed instructions are below. The process to file an adjustment is as follows: Prerequisite: You must do this before you wish to make your first adjustment. Add a new PLU with the following specification (please ask whoever normally adds PLU’s): Barcode: GIFTAIDADJUSTMENT Category: Admission Ticket Short Description: Gift Aid Adjustment Long Description: Gift Aid Adjustment Override Price: Allow Price Override Price: £1.00 Claim Gift Aid: Yes Analysis Code: Select the correct one as required for this PLU to report to. Then, when you wish to make an adjustment there are two stages: Stage 1: Add gift aid adjustment by putting through a transaction Go to a till which has a keyboard (or take one with you). Type into the barcode box ‘GIFTAIDADJUSTMENT’ and press the Enter key. Click on the price. Enter the adjustment amount (ignore whether it’s positive or negative for now) that you wish to make and press the enter key. Please note that this value is treated as a normal gift aid transaction, i.e. the actual adjustment to the claim will be 20/80ths of this value. If the adjustment is negative then refund the above item (how you do this will depend on your till configuration, but normally you would select the item, then go into the ‘Supervisor’ menu and press the ‘Refund’ button). Press the ‘Subtotal’ then the ‘Cash’ button. The ‘Gift Aid Details’ screen will appear. If your adjustment is negative these details are not sent to the HMRC but are just a record for the adjustment reason. Some details like the postcode though will need to appear genuine for the program to let you continue. Press the ‘Exact Money’ button to complete the transaction. Stage 2: You must now cancel-out the value of the above transaction by putting through another transaction of the opposite value, but which is not gift aided. This ensures the cash-up and transaction reports will be correct. Type into the barcode box ‘GIFTAIDADJUSTMENT’ and press the ‘Enter’ key. Click on the price. Enter the adjustment amount (ignore whether it’s positive or negative for now) that you wish to make and press the ‘Enter’ key. Please note that this value is treated as a normal gift aid transaction, i.e. the actual adjustment to the claim will be 20/80ths of this value. If the adjustment you just performed was positive then you will need to make this balancing transaction negative by refunding the above item (how you do this will depend on your till configuration, but normally you would select the item, then go into the ‘Supervisor’ menu and press the ‘Refund’ button). Toggle gift-aid off (there will normally be a button on the till screen that does this). Press the ‘Subtotal’ then the ‘Cash’ button. The ‘Gift Aid Details’ screen will appear. If your adjustment is negative these details are not sent to the HMRC but are just a record for the adjustment reason. Some details like the postcode though will need to appear genuine for the program to let you continue. Press the ‘Exact Money’ button to complete the transaction.",

We have looked for a method to make this very easy for you but have been unable to find such a method that leaves an audit trail and does not affect your Transaction / Cashup reports.

Who can use Customer data 4. Where the GDPR Account Preferences Appear 4.1 Back Office Software and PoS 4.2 E-Commerce. Basket Page 5. Customer Data Extract 6. Customer Data Anonymisation 7. Auto-Anonymisation Introduction Once the GDPR module has been purchased and is turned on, then whenever data that is subject to GDPR requirements is collected (e.g. the customer or member contact details), a screen pops up during the data collection. This screen contains a tick-box list of GDPR preferences that can be filled in by your staff when this form appears on the till or in the MStore back-office software, or by the customer themselves when making a purchase on a MStore e-commerce page. As well as choosing the GDPR preferences for customers that chose to be contacted, there is also the ability to choose to not be contacted. The manual explains the following: How to turn on the GDPR module (* see above). Setting up the responses to the GDPR questions as per your business requirements. Capturing customer GDPR preferences. Extracting GDPR compliant customer data into Microsoft Excel. How to anonymise a single customer record. How to delete all photos and documents that were stored against all customer records. Auto-anonymisation of customer data. Please Note: Once the GDPR module has been turned on, the check boxes of “Ok to Mail” and “Ok to Email” are now redundant and will no longer show on the system. If you require existing customer marketing preferences data to be transformed into the new GDPR options, please contact your Account Manager who can quote for this work and training on setting up and using the GDPR module. So do not tun the GDPR module on without discussing this with K3. For this reason if you do not already have the GDPR module, then you will not be able to turn this on (as detailed in Section 2) unless K3 have enabled this functionality in the background. Enabling the GDPR Module To turn on the GDPR module, please follow the steps below: 1. Click the ‘Setup’ icon. 2. Click the ‘System’ icon. 3. Double click on ‘System Options’. 4. Click on the ‘General’ tab. 5. Click in the box next to ‘Use GDPR Module’, so the box becomes ticked. 6. Click the ‘Apply’ button 7. Finally, click the ‘Close’ button. GDPR ‘Lookup Groups’ To comply with the new General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), three additional ‘Lookup Groups’ describing your GDPR account preference options have been added to the ‘K3|mstore’ back office software. These can be found by: 1. Clicking on ‘Setup’. 2. Next click on ‘System’. 3. Finally, double click on ‘Lookup Items’. The three new ‘Lookup Groups’ that have been created for use with the GDPR module are shown below: As shown above the three new ‘Lookup Groups’ are named as follows: GDPR. Reason for Customer data. GDPR. How Customer data used. GDPR. Who can use Customer data. There are default entries (‘Lookup Items’) in each of these ‘Lookup Groups’ and these are detailed on the following pages. As usual you can add, amend and delete the ‘Lookup Items’ so that they meet the GDPR requirements of your specific business. Please note that adding / editing ‘Lookup Items’ is not covered in this manual. If you do not know how to add or edit ‘Lookup Items’, then this will be covered in the training that comes along with the purchase of the GDPR module. The ‘Lookup Groups’ used by the GDPR functionality are detailed in the following pages, you simply need to add the required ‘Lookup Items’ into each of these ‘Lookup Groups’ in the usual way. 3.1 GDPR. 'How Customer Data Used' A sample of the above ‘Lookup Group’ and ‘Lookup Items’ are shown below. 3.2 GDPR. Reason for Customer data A sample of the above ‘Lookup Group’ and ‘Lookup Items’ are shown below. 3.3 GDPR. Who can use Customer data A sample of the above ‘Lookup Group’ and ‘Lookup Items’ are shown below. Where the GDPR Preferences Appear 4.1 Back Office Software and PoS Once the GDPR module is turned on, the system will prompt the operator to enter the ‘GDPR Account Preferences’ automatically, immediately after you have added the relevant contact details. If adding a record using the ‘New’ record button in either the Members screen, or the Customers screen, then the ‘GDPR Account Preferences’ will appear after adding the contact details (as per the screen below). Note: The operator must select the “Do not make any contact” option if the customer prefers not to be contacted. The system will not allow the customer record to be saved with no option selected! Once the GDPR module is turned on, the ‘GDPR Account Preferences’ screen will also appear after adding the contact details via either the Member, Booking or Event Wizards screens in either the MStore software or on the till. Please Note: once the GDPR module has been turned on, the check boxes of “Ok to Mail” and “Ok to Email” are now redundant and will no longer show on the system. If you require existing customer marketing preferences data to be transformed into the new GDPR options, please contact your Account Manager who can quote for this work and training on setting up and using the GDPR module. 4.2 E-Commerce. Basket Page Once the GDPR module has been turned on, the same ‘GDPR Account Preferences’ options will also appear on the ‘Basket’ page of all your ‘K3|mstore’ e-commerce pages. A sample of how the ‘GDPR Account Preferences’ may appear on a MStore e-commerce page is shown below. The customer simply selects from the GDPR tick box options you configured earlier. Please Note: How this may appear on your e-commerce pages will obviously depend on the styling of your e-commerce pages, and your online payment provider, so your ‘Customer Preferences’ may not appear exactly the same as shown above (the above screenshot is just a sample for demonstration purposes). However, the ‘GDPR Account Preferences’ that show on your e-commerce pages will be the ones you have created, as detailed in the previous pages of this manual. For customers using his first time online then please discuss this with your Account Manager. WK3 may need to be commissioned to do some web page styling work, which will need to be agreed before this can go live on our e-commerce pages. Customer Data Extract A button has been added to both the Customers and Members screens to extract customer data to Microsoft Excel (as long as you or your own IT team have installed this on the required computers). The button is as per the one shown below. On clicking the data will automatically create and open a data extract in Microsoft Excel that includes: Customer personal information (names, addresses, telephone numbers etc.) Account Preferences Booking History Transaction History Information about customer letters (subject, when sent) History of Account Actions Customer Data Anonymisation Functionality has been added to the ‘K3|mstore’ back office to anonymise personal data upon the request from a customer. The button is in both the Customers and Members screens and is as shown below: When the operator clicks this button and confirms they wish to proceed with anonymisation the system will check for Bookings, Invoices and Sales Orders outstanding for the account (and if there are not any outstanding), then this will delete all personal customer information including: Names. Addresses. Telephone numbers. Emails. Direct Debit Details (only for customers who have purchased this module). Anonymise Sales Orders and Invoices. Reset account preferences to the “Do not make any contact” GDPR option. If a single customer on an account with more than one member gets anonymised, then any photos of that customer will be deleted but not the documents linked to the account (because we cannot tell which contact documents relate to). If it’s a single customer account or the last contact, then any linked documents will also be deleted. N.B. the system will keep an audit of who has changed account preferences, when they did it and what change they made. An audit will also be kept of when customer data has been anonymised, which records are affected and who performed the action. Please Note: If you need to delete any photos or documents stored on the SQL server, then please raise a ticket with K3 Support. A procedure can be carried out to delete such data by running commands in SQL, so this will need to be carried out by K3. Auto-Anonymisation Anonymisation of customer data stored in the MStore software can be configured to run automatically. However this is a chargeable \"add on\" and if required, please contact your Account Manager. Once turned on, this option will ensure customer records are automatically anonymised in bulk (e.g. once per month) The criteria for anonymisation will need to be discussed but anonymisation is usually set up for for customers who: Have not renewed their membership for over X years. Have not had any bookings for over X years. Have not raised a sales order for over X years. Have not been invoiced for over X years. Have not purchased any item through the MStore system for over X years. Please note that the auto-anonymisation of Gift Aid transactions (where applicable) will only be for Gift Aid transactions that are greater than 7 years old. Unless K3 are advised otherwise by your organisation",

    "text": "‘Lookup Items’ are required for many modules of the K3|mstore back office software, where the contents of dropdown menus can be user-defined. Each of the ‘Lookup Items’ must belong to a ‘Lookup Group’, the name of which corresponds to the specific dropdown menu you are trying to add to. Please note, not all dropdown menus are user-defined, some have fixed content which cannot be amended in the K3|mstore back office software. Commonly used ‘Lookup Groups’ you are often required to add ‘Lookup Items’ to include: Account Flags, Account Source, Account Type, Booking Source, Booking Types, Session Types, Session/Tour Leaders. The dropdown menus that you can control can be found and amended as detailed below: 1. Click on ‘Setup’. 2. Click on ‘System’. 3. Double click on ‘Lookup Items’. Select the required ‘Lookup Group’ from the dropdown. (in this example we will select the ‘Lookup Group’ called ‘Booking Types’) Click on the ‘New’ icon here to add a new ‘Lookup Item’ (to the selected Lookup Group). Enter a ‘Code’ (e.g. CO) and the required ‘Description’ for the new ‘Lookup Item’ (e.g. Corporate Bookings). Click ‘Apply’ to add the new ‘Lookup Item’. Repeat as required until all the items have been added. Click on ‘Close’ once you have finished adding all the required Lookup Items.",

    "text": "TABLE OF CONTENTS Introduction MACS Scanner Operation Validating a Member Card Member Photo System Configuration Settings Confirm Entry System Configuration Setting Validating a Booking Enforce Booking Date Configuration Setting Validating a Uniquely Numbered Ticket / Wristband Introduction This manual explains how to use a MACS scanner that you have purchased and had configured by K3 to: Validate Memberships. Validate Bookings. Validating Uniquely Numbered Tickets/Wristbands This manual only covers validation of the above using a MACS scanner but does not cover up the set up / selling of 'Memberships', 'Uniquely Numbered Tickets' or 'Wristbands'. Likewise this manual does not cover the set up and process of making bookings, or the set up of the MACS scanner hardware or software. If you have not purchased the required MACS scanner hardware or app or require information or training on any of the functionality mentioned above, or elsewhere in this manual, then please contact your Customer Success Account manager for more information and a quote. MACS Scanner Operation If you have purchased only the MACS scanning functionality from K3, then on powering on the mobile device you should be presented with the following screen. If not, then you need to double click on the relevant icon on the device's ‘Home’ screen to open the application or whether you need to navigate to and open the app on this device. If you do not now how to access the app then your IT team or your colleagues may know how this was set up on your device. If you still cannot access the app then (as long as this app has been purchased from and installed by K3 already on this device, then log a ticket with our Support Team in the usual way. When you have the following screen open, enter the PIN number you have been provided by your manager. Next tap the ‘OK’ button. Next tap the ‘Check Barcodes’ option. Validating a Member Card First tap on the ‘Mem/Tkt’ button. Next, scan the member card, or enter card number in the box shown. Click the ‘Go’ button. If you were presented with a valid member card (i.e. one that is not expired), the following screen will be displayed. In order to process this member entry, you must (if present) press the ‘Confirm Entry’ button. You will be back at the screen below. If you try and validate a card of an expired member, the following screen will be displayed. N.B. as this membership is not valid the entry will not be processed, even if you click ‘Confirm Entry’. If you entered an invalid member card number by accident, the following screen will be displayed. N.B. as this membership is not valid the entry will not be processed, even if you click ‘Confirm Entry’. Member Photo System Configuration Settings Please note that (i) if you take member photos and (ii) want them to show when validating member cards, on a MACS scanner, a setting can be turned on to show the member photo. Once this has been turned on, the member photo will be shown here. To turn this functionality on the MACS scanner, click ‘Close’ on the above screen. At the following screen, click on the ‘Config Settings’ button. At the bottom of the ‘System Config’ screen that appears, you will see the following options. N.B. please do not touch any other options on this screen unless informed to do so! To add the ability to see the member photo (if taken) when a member card is scanned, this has to be enabled. To enable this functionality click on the box to the left of ‘Use Member Photos’ button, so it becomes ticked. Alternatively, to disable this functionality click on the same box, so it becomes unticked. Next, click on the ‘Save’ button. On processing the next member card, you will notice the member photo (if taken) will be shown here. Confirm Entry System Configuration Setting There is a setting that can be enabled so that you have to press the ‘Confirm Entry’ button to admit the member. If there is no requirement to do this (i.e. when scanning a valid card, the entry is confirmed automatically), this button can be removed. Access the ‘Config Settings’ options as explained previously. At the bottom of the ‘System Config’ screen you will see the following options. As stated previously, please do not touch any other options on this screen unless informed to do so! If you want the user to have to press the ‘Confirm Entry’ button when validating a member card, ensure the option ‘Ask to Confirm Before Processing?’ is ticked. Alternatively, to disable this functionality click on the same box, so it becomes unticked. Next, click on the ‘Save’ button. On processing the next member card, you will notice the ‘Confirm Entry’ button has disappeared. Without the ‘Confirm Entry’ button, then on scanning the card, or entering the card number manually, any valid member will be processed automatically. Validating a Booking Type in, or scan the required booking reference in the 'Scan Booking' field and click ‘Go’. If you were presented with a valid booking reference, the following screen will be displayed. Please note when the ‘Confirm Entry’ button is present, this must be pressed to finish the validation process. N.B. if you would rather not press the ‘Confirm Entry’ button and want the system to automatically process valid bookings (only), this button can be removed. If you try and validate a booking that has already been completed, the following message will be displayed. N.B. as this booking is invalid, it will not be processed, even if you click ‘Confirm Entry’. If you try and validate an incorrect booking reference, the following message will be displayed. N.B. as this booking is invalid, it will not be processed, even if you click ‘Confirm Entry’. If you try and validate a booking that was cancelled in MStore, the following message will be displayed. N.B. as this booking is invalid, it will not be processed, even if you click ‘Confirm Entry’. Enforce Booking Date Configuration Setting The ‘Ask to Confirm Before processing’ can be turned off as required. If required, there is also the ability to enforce the booking date on validating a booking. To turn this functionality on: Access the ‘Config Settings’ options as explained previously. At the bottom of the ‘System Config’ screen you will see the following options. As stated previously, please do not touch any other options on this screen unless informed to do so! Click the box to the left of ‘Enforce Booking Date’, so that it becomes ticked (or unticked as required). Click the ‘Save’ button to save this setting. If you try and validate a booking that is not for today’s date, the following message will be displayed. N.B. as this booking is invalid, it will not be processed, even if you click ‘Confirm Entry’. N.B. if you wanted to remove the ‘Confirm Entry’ button, then to turn this off/on is detailed in this guide. With this setting turned off, the operator will see the same screen if they try and validate a booking that is not for today’s date, but you will notice the ‘Confirm Entry’ button has now disappeared. As stated previously, as this booking is an invalid, this booking cannot be not be processed. Validating a Uniquely Numbered Ticket / Wristband If you have purchased and have had the MACS scanners configured for validating either 'Uniquely Numbered Tickets' or 'Wristbands', then open and logon to the MACS as explained earlier in this document. Next tap the ‘Check Barcodes’ option as before. At the next screen, ensure the ‘Mem/Tkt’ option is selected, by clicking on it. If you scan a valid uniquely numbered ticket/wristband, the following screen will be displayed. If you scan a uniquely numbered ticket / wristband that’s already used, the following screen will be displayed. If you scan a uniquely numbered ticket/wristband for the incorrect date, the following will be displayed. For wristbands only: if the scanned wristband is in a range of wristbands that have been cancelled in the MStore back office software, then the following screen will be displayed. Once finished using the app click 'Close' to exit this screen. You will then return to the 'Main Menu' screen. Then click 'Logout' to return to the 'Login' (PIN entry) screen ready for the next user. If required click 'Quit' to totally exit the MACS scanner software as required.",
