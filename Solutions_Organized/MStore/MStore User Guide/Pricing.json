    "text": "TABLE OF CONTENTS Introduction Analysis Code – Structure Example Analysis Code – Set Up Setting Up a 1st Tier Analysis Code Setting Up a 2nd Tier Analysis Code Setting Up a 3rd Tier Analysis Code Introduction ‘Analysis Codes’ are simply categories for sales reports, in which each of the items that you sell are allocated. This enables you to get sales reports by the ‘Analysis Codes’ you set up. Please note that ‘Analysis Codes’ are not set up for each item you sell, this is known as a PLU (Price Look Up). The process of setting up a PLU is outside the scope of this manual, as these are set up elsewhere in the MStore software. Please note that when you set up a PLU, it is assigned to a specific ‘Analysis Code’. This determines which ‘Analysis Code’ this PLU will report to in the relevant sales reports in the MStore software. An example of a key report which uses the analysis code structure is the ‘Daily Transaction Analysis’ report. An extract of this report is shown below so you can see how the analysis code set up affects your reports. The below data for simplicity shows data for a single 'Analysis Code' and the breakdown of item (PLU) sales within that. However when you run a report it will typically be showing data for all the 'Analysis Codes' selected by using the report filters. How to set up the ‘Analysis Codes’ that are used in specific sales (transaction based) reports is detailed in this guide. Analysis Code – Structure Example The ‘Analysis Codes’ structure can be set up as a one, two, or three tier (maximum) hierarchy. The number of tiers simply depends on your reporting requirements. An example of a simple one tier analysis code structure would be when you only want a split between ‘Hospitality’, ‘Admissions’ and ‘Retail’ sales. If you then need a more detailed break-down for your sales reports than just the first-tier analysis code, you can add a second tier to give the level of detail required. For example, if you wanted to get a report for ‘Admissions’ total sales but also want a breakdown from this into further categories (‘Analysis Codes’) for ‘Adults’, ‘Children’ and ‘Senior Citizens’, then these would be added as second-tier ‘Analysis Codes’ under ‘Admissions’. Likewise, if you need a further split of any second-tier analysis code you can add a third tier as required. Taking the above example, you may need to split the ‘Adults’ second-tier analysis code into categories for ‘Adult Single Tickets’ and ‘Adult Group Tickets’. In which case these would each be set up as a third tier under the ‘Adults’ analysis code. How to set up this tiered ‘Analysis Codes’ structure is detailed below. Analysis Code – Set Up To set up ‘Analysis Codes’ please 1. click on Setup then 2. click Pricing then 3. double click Analysis Codes. Please note that each analysis code must have a ‘code’ and a ‘description’. You can use any ‘Description’ you like (maximum 50 characters) but the ‘Code’ for each tier has a specific structure. An example of the three-tier hierarchy are shown below: 1st tier code structure: ## 2nd tier code structure ##-### 3rd tier code structure: ##-###-#### N.B. you must include the hyphen(s) ‘-‘ in a 2nd or 3rd tier code as shown above. Setting Up a 1st Tier Analysis Code Click on the text ‘Product Groups’ (at the top of the screen), so it becomes highlighted. Next click on the button here to add a new 1st tier analysis code. Now type in the required 2-digit code in the ‘Code:’ box. Next type in the required description for this analysis code in the ‘Short Desc:’ box. Click on the ‘Apply’ button to create the 1st tier analysis code. Repeat as required until all 1st tier ‘Analysis Codes’ have been set up. Setting Up a 2nd Tier Analysis Code To add a 2nd tier analysis code, click on the 1st tier analysis code you will add this new code under. (so that the required 1st tier analysis code is highlighted blue, e.g. ‘Admissions’). Next click on the button here to add a new 2nd tier analysis code. Now type in the required code in the ‘Code:’ box, which must be in the format ##-###. Next type in the required description for this analysis code in the ‘Short Desc:’ box. Click on the ‘Apply’ button to create the analysis code. Repeat as required until all 2nd tier ‘Analysis Codes’ have been set up. Setting Up a 3rd Tier Analysis Code You must first navigate to the required 2nd tier analysis code. To do this click on the ‘+’ symbol here so you can see the relevant 2nd tier analysis codes. To add a 3rd tier analysis code, click on the 2nd tier analysis code you will add this code under. N.B. the 'Analysis Code' that you clicked on should now become highlighted blue, e.g. ‘Admissions Adult’). Next click on the button here to add a new 3rd tier analysis code. Now type in the required code in the ‘Code:’ box, which must be in the format ##-###-####. Next type in the required description for this analysis code in the ‘Short Desc:’ box. Click on the ‘Apply’ button to create the analysis code. Repeat as required until all 3rd tier ‘Analysis Codes’ have been set up. Once all ‘Analysis Codes’ have been added, click on the ‘Close’ button. You would now repeat the processes to create all the 1st, 2nd and 3rd tier ' Analysis Codes' for the entire business. Please Note: The 'Analysis Codes' structure required for your business will not necessarily follow any of the sample structures detailed in the above screenshots. You will need to have internal discussions about proposed 'Analysis Codes' structure that is best for your business before implementing this, as this structure affects all future reporting. To re-structure this after you have gone live potentially requires a lot of work both in restructuring the 'Analysis Codes' but also you are likely to need to re-map all PLUs to the new ‘Analysis Codes’ structure. This can be done by using Setup > Pricing > Price Lookup Index to amend PLU records in the usual way. Send any changes to ‘Analysis Codes’ and PLUs to the tills using Edit > Recreate Till Data.",

    "text": "TABLE OF CONTENTS Introduction Finding the ‘New PLU/Stock Item Wizard ‘Type’ Screen ‘Price’ Screen ‘PLU Type’ Screen ‘Codes/Finish’ Screen Introduction This manual demonstrates creating ‘Admission Ticket’ PLU’s using the ‘New PLU/Stock Wizard’. Finding the ‘New PLU/Stock Item Wizard 1. Click on ‘Setup’ then 2. click ‘Pricing’ then 3. double click on the ‘New PLU/Stock Wizard’ icon. ‘Type’ Screen You will then see the following screen. Click on the circle to the left of the ‘Admission Ticket’ option. Now click on the ‘Next’ button. ‘Price’ Screen In the next screen click in the ‘Short description’ and enter the PLU description required. N.B. the ‘Short Description’ is the description that shown on the till and on receipts. We recommend that this description is limited to 20 characters and should not include any punctuation/special characters. Now click in the ‘Long Description’ box. You will notice the ‘Long Description’ box is automatically populated with the same information you typed in the ‘Short Description’ box. The ‘Long Description’ is used on the reports in the MStore back office software, so you can enter a longer description here if required. To do this click in the ‘Long Description’ box and amend the information as required. Once the required ‘Long Description’ has been entered you must now specify the ‘Pricing Type’. There are four different options: Allow: This allows the till operator to amend the price. Do Not Allow: This will not allow the till operator to amend the price. Force Price Entry: This will prompt the till operator to enter a price when selling the item. Embedded: this is where the price is embedded in a barcode (this isn’t normally used for admission PLU’s) In this specific example we have selected ‘Do not allow’. This option means the price of the PLU cannot be manually changed by anyone at the till. Now select the required ‘Analysis Code’ by clicking on the arrow to the right of the ‘Sales analysis code:’ box. If you have not yet set up the ‘Analysis Code’, you can do so by clicking the ‘Look up’ button. From the dropdown list that appears, click on the required ‘Analysis Code’ to select it. In the above example we selected the ‘Analysis Code’ called Admissions. Now select the required ‘VAT code’ by clicking on the arrow here. From the dropdown list that appears, select the ‘VAT code’ you require by clicking on it here. Now click in the ‘Sell Price (Inc Vat)’ field. Type in the required selling price for this PLU (e.g. £10.00 is entered as 10.00). If you offer gift aid on an admission ticket the price WITH gift aid should be entered here. Please note if the price without gift aid is lower, this price is entered after the PLU is created by editing it. Now you must select the ‘Price Valid from:’ and ‘Price Valid to:’ dates here as required. N.B. the default price validity is for 10 years from the date the PLU was created, but set these as required. To select the ‘Price Valid from:’ click on the arrow to the right of the field and the date selector appears. The ‘Price Valid from:’ is usually the date from which you want to start selling tickets for the event. But set this as required as the from / to dates determine when this item can be sold at the price specified. Click on the text for the year (e.g. click on 2025 at the top of the calendar), then use the up/down arrows to select the year. Click on the text for the month (e.g. click on January at the top of the calendar) and the month selector appears. Click on the required month name on the list that appears to select it. Then click on the date in the selected month. This selected date will now be showing in the the ‘Price Valid from:' field. Repeat the process to change the ‘Price valid to:’ date as required. This is often the last date you want to sell tickets for the event. In our example the tickets went on sale form 01/01/25 for an event that is on 06/07/2025. For some customers who have (i) integrations from MStore to 3rd party finance integrations, or (ii) that require to use reports in MStore that report transaction data by 3rd party finance system Nominal Codes, then these fields may be required. This will only work if nominal codes have been set up in advance in MStore. Setting up and mapping nominal codes it outside the scope of this guide, but if you need more information please contact your Account Manager. If these have been set up in MStore and need to be mapped to PLU level data, then there is the ability to select 2 nominal codes per PLU using the dropdowns shown if required. If not just leave these fields blank. Once the required price validity has been set as necessary, click on the ‘Next’ button. ‘PLU Type’ Screen If ‘Gift Aid’ is not to be claimed for this PLU, then leave this box un-ticked. If ‘Gift Aid’ is to be claimed for this PLU, then click in this box so a tick appears in it. If the ‘Gift Aid?’ box is ticked, you also need to specify whether you add an extra donation here This would be where the price WITH gift aid is HIGHER than the price WITHOUT gift aid. If so click the 'Add extra donation?' box, so it becomes ticked. N.B. at the till an online there is the ability to opt to gift aid or not gift aid and the price changes accordingly. Please note the \"without\" gift aid price is set up after the PLU is created in the Wizard, by editing the PLU. Now you must specify the footfall quantity that is to be recorded against this PLU as required. To do this click in the 'Footfall' box and type in the required footfall (as a number, e.g. 1). If a ticket is to be printed when this admission PLU is sold, then click on the arrow here. From the list of available ticket types that appears, click on the required ticket design to select it. Please not ticket designs need to be set up in advance but are outside the scope of this manual. In the 'Number per ticket' field enter the number of tickets that were printed when this PLU was sold (e.g. 1). N.B. there are other fields in this screen but in this guide we are just covering the basic tickets requirements. Now click on the ‘Next’ button to continue. ‘Codes/Finish’ Screen At the following screen type in the code you require for this admission PLU here. For all the admission ticket PLU’s, you must create your own unique PLU ‘Code’ for each PLU. Please use an alpha-numeric code when creating your own codes for PLU’s. Decide on your own PLU coding system and ensure that all people entering new PLU’s use the same PLU coding system. Type in the code for this PLU here as required, in this example we chose to use the code “ADSE1”. Once you have typed in the required code, then click on the ‘Add’ button here. Next click on the ‘Finish’ button to finish adding this PLU. You will then see the following screen. Now click on the ‘OK’ button. You now know how to add ‘Admission Ticket’ PLU’s in the MStore back office software. Please ensure you send any new data to your tills in the usual way, using Edit > Recreate Till Data.",

    "text": "TABLE OF CONTENTS Introduction Assigning a Price Break to a PLU Updating In-House Prices Updating Internet Prices Introduction ‘Price Breaks’ are a way of setting up price changes to occur on specific dates. Many of our customers use this functionality for setting up all the new admission ticket prices a month in advance of the start of a new season. Applying ‘Price Breaks’ in this way, will ensure the tills, or the internet prices (for customers who have purchased the ‘Online Bookings’ module) already have, and automatically use the new price from the first day of the new season. Although often used for changes to admission ticket prices, price breaks can equally be used to set up scheduled price changes for PLU’s sold in the retail, or hospitality environments. The process of creating and applying ‘Price Breaks’ is explained in this manual. Assigning a Price Break to a PLU The first step in adding a ‘Price Break’ is to find the PLU. To do this 1. Click on ‘Setup’, 2. click ‘Pricing’, 3. double click on ‘Price Lookup Index’. Use any of the search options to find the PLU that requires updating in the usual way. In this example as the code was known, this was just entered into the ‘Scan/Enter Code:’ field. The ‘Search’ button was then clicked to bring up the list of PLU’s found (in this case just one PLU). Double click on the PLU record that you want to add a ‘Price Break’ to. Once in the PLU Maintenance screen, click on the ‘View/Add Price’ button. Please as this PLU has the gift aid setting to enable the price with (higher) and (lower) without gift aid to be entered. N.B. the 'Pricing Details' grid does vary depending on whether or not gift aid settings have been applied to the PLU. In the ‘Price History’ screen, the current prices and any ‘Price Breaks’ that have already been set up will be shown. In the example below, the current price is set to £7 with gift aid and £6.30 without gift aid. But a there is going to be a price change so we need needs to apply new prices to this PLU for a different date range (a 'Price Break'). The process of creating a new ‘Price Break’ is explained below. Before changing the price, the date that the current price ends on must be set correctly, as overlapping the end and start dates causes problems and must be avoided! To do this, click on the down arrow next to ‘Valid To’, then the calendar to select an end date for the current price. To select a new year click on the year (at the top of the calendar) and use the up/down arrows to select the required year. Next click on the month and a pop up appears, click the required month. Finally, click the date on the calendar that the price ends on. Once the new ‘Valid To’ date has been selected, click on the ‘Apply’ button. The ‘Valid To’ date in the ‘Pricing History’ window on the right shows as updated. To enter the new prices click on the ‘New’ Icon (the blank sheet of paper) where shown. Now enter the new 'Inhouse Prices' and ‘Internet Prices’ as required. Please as this PLU has the gift aid setting to enable the price with (higher) and (lower) without gift aid to be entered. N.B. the 'Pricing Details' grid does vary depending on whether or not gift aid settings have been applied to the PLU. Next set the start and end dates for the new price (ensuring these do not overlap with the previous price). Do this by clicking on the down arrows next to the ‘Valid From’ date and ‘Valid To’ date and select the new dates required. When the new price, dates and VAT rate have been set as required, click on ‘Apply’. A new line appears in the ‘Pricing History’ window with the new details. To exit this screen, click ‘Close’. At the next screen (the ‘PLU Maintenance’ window), click ‘Close’. At the next screen (the ‘Prices Index’ window), click ‘Close’. Updating In-House Prices The process of updating the “in-house” prices is by carrying out the ‘Recreate Till Data’ process. This is done in the usual way, which is: Click on 1. ‘Edit’ then 2. ‘Recreate Till Data’ At this point we usually recommend sending to all tills, by clicking ‘Apply’. At the “Till data recreated successful!” message, click ‘Ok’. You can expand the ‘Departments and Tills’ tree in the usual way (by clicking the ‘+’ symbol). Then you could select / deselect tills as required, by right clicking them before clicking ‘Apply’. However, we do not usually recommend this, as this could lead to different tills having different prices. Updating Internet Prices To update the 'Internet Prices' entered so the relevant K3 e-commerce pages (for those customers who have purchased these modules) then first you need to access the K3 Online Admin Page. To access this page in the MStore software: 1. click on ‘Setup’, 2. then click ‘Bookings’ and then 3. double click ‘Booking Templates’. Next click on the 'Website Login' button. This will now open your default internet browser to access your specific admin menu page URL. You will need to ensure your computer has a working internet connection and your preferred web browser software is installed. Your ‘Windows User Account’ must not have any restrictions that would prevent internet access or browsing. Your own IT department or external IT support team will need to assist if you have any issues accessing the internet, as K3 are not responsible for supporting or enabling access to the internet.

Applying ‘Price Breaks’ in this way, will ensure the tills, or the internet prices (for customers who have purchased the ‘Online Bookings’ module) already have, and automatically use the new price from the first day of the new season. Although often used for changes to admission ticket prices, price breaks can equally be used to set up scheduled price changes for PLU’s sold in the retail, or hospitality environments. The process of creating and applying ‘Price Breaks’ is explained in this manual.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p dir=\"ltr\">&nbsp;</p><h1 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"Assigning-a-Price-Break-to-a-PLU\"><strong dir=\"ltr\">Assigning a Price Break to a PLU</strong></h1><p dir=\"ltr\">The first step in adding a ‘Price Break’ is to find the PLU.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">To do this <strong dir=\"ltr\">1.</strong> Click on ‘<strong>Setup</strong>’, <strong dir=\"ltr\">2.</strong> click<strong>&nbsp;</strong>‘<strong>Pricing</strong>’, <strong dir=\"ltr\">3.&nbsp;</strong>double click on<strong>&nbsp;</strong>‘<strong>Price Lookup Index</strong>’.</p><p><img src=\"https://s3-eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/euc-cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/103191394586/original/GnzqeRpneCFAQ1IXD3u1YBOxlmYk6qAcog.png?1739984823\" style=\"width: auto; max-width: 100%;\" class=\"fr-fic fr-fil fr-dib fr-bordered\" data-attachment=\"[object Object]\" data-id=\"103191394586\"></p><p dir=\"ltr\">&nbsp;</p><p>Use any of the search options to find the PLU that requires updating in the usual way.</p><p>In this example as the code was known, this was just entered into the ‘<strong>Scan/Enter Code:</strong>’ field.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The <strong>‘Search’</strong> button was then clicked to bring up the list of PLU’s found (in this case just one PLU).</p><p><strong><img src=\"https://s3-eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/euc-cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/103191792981/original/neOUbH0t3Ncjd0GZbeGns312GKlR9tkgNg.png?1740073990\" style=\"width: 718px; max-width: 100%;\" class=\"fr-fic fr-fil fr-dib fr-bordered\" data-attachment=\"[object Object]\" data-id=\"103191792981\"></strong></p><p dir=\"ltr\">Double click on the PLU record that you want to add a ‘Price Break’ to.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Once in the PLU Maintenance screen, click on the <strong>‘View/</strong><strong>Add Price’</strong> button.</p><p><strong><img src=\"https://s3-eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/euc-cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/103191792777/original/xGk4IWT6VpWDAQBQ0wfiKgpZMf8W7Z9X-g.png?1740073906\" style=\"width: auto; max-width: 100%;\" class=\"fr-fic fr-fil fr-dib fr-bordered\" data-attachment=\"[object Object]\" data-id=\"103191792777\"></strong></p><p dir=\"ltr\">Please as this PLU has the gift aid setting to enable the price with (higher) and (lower) without gift aid to be entered.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">N.B. the 'Pricing Details' grid does vary depending on whether or not gift aid settings have been applied to the PLU.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><br></p><p dir=\"ltr\">In the ‘<strong>Price History</strong>’ screen, the current prices and any ‘Price Breaks’ that have already been set up will be shown.

The ‘Promotion Wizard’ is designed to be a user-friendly method for setting up promotions. This manual aims to provide a step-by-step guide on how to create your promotions using the promotion wizard. To begin using the ‘Promotion Wizard’ we must first locate it within the MStore back office software. To open the ‘Promotion Wizard’ click on 1. ‘Setup’, then 2. ‘Pricing’ then 3. double click ‘Promotion Wizard’. 'Type' Screen This section will explain each of the promotion types that can be set up using the ‘Promotion Wizard’, before moving onto the next phase of entering the promotion details. There are three types of promotions that can be created using the ‘Promotion Wizard’, these are: ‘Discount’ Promotions. ‘Multi-Buy’ Promotions. ‘Basket’ Promotions. The ‘Type’ screen displays each of the three types of promotions There is also a brief description of how each promotion type works. The above promotion types are explained in the following pages. Discount Promotion A 'Discount' type promotion can be used to apply the following types of discounts to specified PLU’s: Price reduction by a specified percentage on a PLU(s). Price reduction by a specified amount on a PLU(s). Specific price on a PLU(s). A 'Discount' type promotion can be triggered during a transaction and can fire in the following ways: Everyone/Members/Staff/Managers/Account/Selected The above ways of triggering the promotion are referred to as the ‘Promotion Eligibility’ and are covered later in this guide N.B. for ‘Selected’ promotions you can specify ‘Promotion Conditions’ which must be met in order for the promotion to fire. These conditions specify the quantity of other PLU’s that must be sold before the promotion fires, e.g. you must by two ‘Adult Admission’ PLU’s before you can get 100% discount off a ‘Child Admission’ PLU. Setting up ‘Promotion Conditions’ are covered later. To select this promotion type, click in the circle to the left of the ‘Discount’ text. Once you have selected the promotion type, click on the ‘Next’ button. Now go to Section 2 of this guide. Multi Buy Promotion Multi-Buy promotions are designed to discount a single item when one or more of that same item has been scanned or entered into the till basket. For example, imagine a café has excess stock of Mars bars and they want to setup a “buy two get one free” promotion on Mars bars. In this example the till software will automatically apply the discount but only if there are three Mars bars in the till basket. This is because the promotion conditions are not met until all three Mars bars have been entered or scanned into the till basket. To select this promotion type, simply click in the circle to the left of the ‘Multi-Buy’ text. Once you have selected the promotion type, click on the ‘Next’ button. Now go to Section 2 of this guide. Basket Promotion Basket promotions are designed to discount a single item only after another item (or a group of items) have been scanned or entered into the till. For example, a café wants to setup a promotion that discounts a cup of tea by 100% for any customer that orders a breakfast with that cup of tea. In this example the till software will automatically apply the discount but only if both the breakfast and tea are in the till’s basket. This is because the promotion conditions are not met until both the breakfast and tea are in the till’s basket. To select this promotion type, simply click in the circle to the left of the ‘Basket’ text. Once you have selected the promotion type, click on the ‘Next’ button. 'Description' Screen Now that we have covered the three types of promotions available, we can move onto the next step in creating our promotion. The ‘Description’ screen of the promotion wizard has the following sections Promotion Description Fields. Promotion Group. Promotion Eligibility. Each of the above sections of this screen are explained in the following pages, The location of each of these sections is shown below. Key: (1) Promotion Description fields. (2) ‘Promotion Eligibility’ options. (3) ‘Promotion Group’ selection (drop-down). (4) ‘Promotion Group’ “Lookup” Icon. Promotion 'Description' Fields Once we’ve chosen a promotion type, we will need to provide a detailed ‘Description’ as well as a ‘Short Description’ for the promotion being set up. It is important to use descriptions that are easy to understand because they will be used in various places throughout the MStore back office software and when using the till software The ‘Description Field’ will show in the relevant reports in MStore back office software. The ‘Short Description’ field is the description printed on receipts and on the till’s rear display (if present). Type in the required text in the ‘Description’ box. Type in the required text ‘Short Description’ box. Click on the ‘Next’ button once finished to proceed to the next step. Promotion Eligibility Promotion eligibility is crucial in determining how our promotion will work and unsurprisingly who will be eligible for our promotion. By default, every promotion is set with an eligibility of ‘Everyone’, this means all items associated with this promotion will be automatically discounted when it is scanned into the till basket. The major difference between the ‘Everyone’ promotion eligibility type and all the others is that all other eligibility types require the promotion to be activated by a till operator. Meaning the till operator is required to do something that activates the promotion they wish to use (i.e. either press a button on the till or scan a coupon). Please note that if you are setting up a ‘Multi-buy; or ‘Basket’ type promotion, then the promotion eligibility will default to ‘Everyone’ and cannot be changed. For a ‘Discount’ type promotion you must click in the circle to the left of the required option to select it. Each of these promotion eligibility options are explained on the following page. Once you the required ‘Promotion Eligibility’ is selected, click the ‘Next’ button to proceed. Everyone: This discount will be activated automatically when an item meeting the promotion requirements is added to the basket. Members: This promotion eligibility can automatically apply a discount when a member card is swiped or scanned at the till. Please note that this membership promotion will not function unless it has been assigned to the specific membership type(s) that this discount will apply to. Staff: This type of promotion is fired by pressing a specific button on the till. Please note that setting up till buttons is not covered in this manual but for your information the button that fires this promotion must be set up as a ‘Command’ button action, then select the ‘Staff Sale’ option from the drop-down list. Please note that only one staff discount scheme can be in operation on your tills at any time (on some versions). The specific staff discount scheme must be defined in the MStore back office software in the ‘System Options’ screen. This is found in Setup > System > System Options - under the ‘Accounting’ tab Managers: This type of promotion is fired by pressing a specific button on the till. Please note that setting up till buttons is not covered in this manual but for your information the button that fires this promotion must be set up as a ‘Command’ button action, then select the ‘Manager Sale’ option from the drop-down list. Please note that only one manager’s discount scheme can be in operation on your tills at any time (on some versions). this must be defined in the MStore back office software in the ‘System Options’ screen. This is found in Setup > System > System Options - under the ‘Accounting’ tab Selected: This type of promotion must be fired by pressing a specific button on the till (or by scanning a coupon that has a barcode on it that will trigger the promotion). Please note that setting up till buttons is not covered in this manual but for your information the button that fires this promotion must be set up as a ‘Promotion’ button action, then select the required ‘Promotion Scheme’ and ‘Promotion Coupon’ from the relevant drop-down lists. Promotion Group Each promotion you create must be assigned to a Promotion Group. If a promotion group is not assigned to a promotion, then the discounted items will not be shown in the relevant reports. To set a promotion group we can choose from one of the default groups listed within the drop-down menu, or we can create a unique promotion group by selecting the “Lookup” icon. Key: (1) ‘Promotion Group’ selection (drop-down). (2) ‘Promotion Group’ “Lookup” Icon. 'Details' Screen The Promotion Details screen is where we will configure the discount details for all items we wish to include in this promotion. You may notice the ‘Product Groups’ have the same code and description as our ‘Analysis Codes’. This is because they are indeed the same, i.e. ‘Product Groups’ = ‘Analysis Codes’. Key: (1) Analysis Codes. (2) ‘Discount Type’ selection. (3) Discount percentage / amount entry field. Discount Percentage This discount type reduces an item or group of items by a percentage. Click on a product group in the left side of the screen to select that product group. The right side of the screen will now populate with all items within the selected product group. If we want to apply unique discount values to every item, we must select each item individually, then enter an amount in the discount value field and click the ‘Apply’ button. Repeat as required until all items have the correct discount percentage assigned to them. Alternatively, we can click in the ‘Apply to all items in this view’ box so that this is ticked, then click on the ‘Apply’ button. This will apply the discount value to all items within the selected ‘Product Group’. Repeat as required until all the product groups have the correct discount percentage assigned to them. Once all the promotion discounts have been assigned to the item(s) as required, click the ‘Next’ button. Key: (1) Admissions product group. (2) Item showing a discount (15% discount). (3) ‘Discount Percentage’ type selected. (4) ‘Percentage’ discount amount entry field. Reduce By A ‘Reduce By’ type promotion will reduce an item by a set value (e.g. £1.00). The same instructions apply as previously detailed for applying the discount to an item(s) within a product group or applying the discount to an entire product group. Once all the promotion discounts have been assigned to the item(s) as required, click the ‘Next’ button. Key: (1) Admissions product group. (2) Item showing a discount (‘Reduce By’ £4). (3) ‘Reduce By’ type selected. (4) ‘Reduce By’ amount entry field. Promotion Price The 'Promotion Price' discount type is used to set the promotional price of an item. The same instructions apply as in the previous section for applying the discount to an item(s) within a product group or to an entire product group. Once all the promotion discounts have been assigned to the item(s) as required, click the ‘Next’ button. Key: (1) Selected product group. (2) Item showing a discount (‘Special Price’ £12.50). (3) ‘Promotion Price’ type selected. (4) ‘Promotion Price’ entry field. Promotion Conditions The 'Promotion Conditions' screen allows us to specify the number of items that must be purchased in order to enable our promotion. By default, only one item must be purchased to trigger any promotion. Amend the ‘Qualifying Quantity’ (refer to description on the screen) as required for the promotion you are setting up. Now click on the ‘Next’ button to proceed. Key: (1) ‘Qualifying Quantity’ number selection. Promotion Dates/Times This is where we will set the date and time parameters for our new promotion. The first step for setting these parameters is to select a date range. Selecting a date range can be done two different ways: Selecting ‘Valid From’ / ‘Valid To’ Dates. Selecting a Calendar. Once the dates have been specified you can then also specify on which day(s) of the week and at which times of the day the promotion will work using the ‘Day and Times’ settings. Key: (1) ‘Valid From’ / ‘Valid To’ date selectors. (2) ‘Use a Calendar’ tick box. (3) ‘Days and Times’ settings. Important: It is important to remember that both the ‘Valid From’ / ‘Valid To’ dates and the ‘Days and Times’ settings must be configured appropriately. By default, the ‘Promotion Wizard’ will have all days and times of the week selected. If the promotion must only work on certain days this must be specified in the ‘Days and Times’ settings. Valid To/From Dates Using the ‘Valid From’ and ‘Valid To’ drop-down menus is the easiest way to select the required start and end date for the promotion. Clicking the drop-down menu icons will pop-up a small calendar window that allows the user to select the date(s) rather than manually typing them. Select the ‘Valid From’ and ‘Valid To’ dates as required, then click the ‘Next’ button. Important: Remember that this date range determines when this promotion will be start and end, so be sure to select the correct dates! Using a Calendar Using a calendar is very helpful if we already have a calendar period setup in within the back office software. If a calendar has already been set up then we can simply select the ‘Use a Calendar?’ check box and then select the appropriate calendar period from the drop-down menu. However, if we don’t have a calendar period setup already then we can create our own by using the ‘Lookup’ icon next to the calendar drop-down menu. Select the required calendar then click the ‘Next’ button. Key: (1) ‘Use a Calendar’ check-box. (2) Calendar selection (drop-down) and “Lookup” icon. Days and Time Settings This section of the ‘Dates/Times’ screen of the wizard is used to apply our discount to specific days of the week and times of the day. By default every day of the week is selected, so you will notice you the tick box to the left of each day is ticked. You can deselect a day of the week by clicking in the box to the left of that required day, so that it becomes un-ticked. This will mean the promotion will not be active on that day of the week. By default you will also notice that for any day where the promotion is active the promotion ‘Start Time’ and ‘End Time’ cannot be changed. If you want change the start and end times for a promotion then you first need to click in the ‘All Day’ box next to the required day of the week so that it becomes un-ticked. You can now change the start and end time of the promotion to be as required by either typing in the required times (use the 24 hour clock format), or using the up and down arrows to increase or decrease the hours or minutes as required. Key: (1) Day and Times Settings. Once all the required data has been enter click the 'Finish' button to save and add the promotion. Editing Promotions The Wizard is only used to add new promotions. To check / amend a promotion you need to go into the 'Promotions' screen. To open the ‘Promotions’ click on 1. ‘Setup’, then 2. ‘Pricing’ then 3. double click ‘Promotions’. You would then need to first select the 'Promotion Type' of the promotion you want to find. Then select the required promotion 'Description' to edit. Please not all the fields you saw in the Wizard can be found on this screen. But please note where the Wizard had screens then some of this content has a button to view it For example the 'Details' button needs to be clicked to set up the promotion on each PLU/Analysis Code as required. Click 'Apply' once any changes are made. Then click 'Close' and remember to update your tills (Edit > Recreate Till Data) to send any promotion changes to your tills.",

The ‘Promotion Wizard’ is designed to be a user-friendly method for setting up promotions. This manual aims to provide a step-by-step guide on how to create your promotions using the promotion wizard. To begin using the ‘Promotion Wizard’ we must first locate it within the MStore back office software.&nbsp;</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><br></p><p dir=\"ltr\">To open the ‘Promotion Wizard’ click on <strong>1.</strong> ‘Setup’, then <strong>2.</strong> ‘Pricing’ then <strong>3.</strong> double click ‘Promotion Wizard’.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><img src=\"https://s3-eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/euc-cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/103191647093/original/i1nAVr1IcevqosFvwKT-HQrBsuGYJLCg3Q.png?1740055366\" style=\"width: auto; max-width: 100%;\" class=\"fr-fic fr-fil fr-dib fr-bordered\" data-attachment=\"[object Object]\" data-id=\"103191647093\"></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h1 id=\"'Type'-Screen\"><strong dir=\"ltr\">'Type' Screen</strong></h1><p dir=\"ltr\">This section will explain each of the promotion types that can be set up using the ‘Promotion Wizard’, before moving onto the next phase of entering the promotion details. There are three types of promotions that can be created using the ‘Promotion Wizard’, these are:</p><ul><li><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ‘<a href=\"#_Discount\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">Discount</a>’&nbsp;Promotions.</span></li><li><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ‘<a href=\"#_Multi-Buy\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">Multi-Buy</a>’ Promotions.</span></li><li><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ‘<a href=\"#_Basket\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">Basket</a>’ Promotions.</span></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The <strong>‘Type’&nbsp;</strong>screen displays each of the three types of promotions</p><p dir=\"ltr\">There is also a brief description of how each promotion type works.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img width=\"604\" src=\"https://s3-eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/euc-cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/103140259273/original/wqj9l-WapGAheXRK1Qa6a7c7k2u7YdRiVQ.png?1724338271\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dii\" data-attachment=\"[object Object]\" data-id=\"103140259273\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\"></p><p><br></p><p dir=\"ltr\">The above promotion types are explained in the following pages.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2 id=\"Discount-Promotion\"><strong><u dir=\"ltr\">Discount Promotion</u></strong></h2><p dir=\"ltr\">A 'Discount' type promotion can be used to apply the following types of discounts to specified PLU’s:</p><ul><li dir=\"ltr\">Price reduction by a specified percentage on a PLU(s).</li><li dir=\"ltr\">Price reduction by a specified amount on a PLU(s).</li><li dir=\"ltr\">Specific price on a PLU(s).</li></ul><p dir=\"ltr\">A 'Discount' type promotion can be triggered during a transaction and can fire in the following ways:</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><br></p><p><strong dir=\"ltr\">Everyone/Members/Staff/Managers/Account/Selected&nbsp;</strong></p><p dir=\"ltr\">The above ways of triggering the promotion are referred to as the ‘Promotion Eligibility’ and are covered later in this guide</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><br></p><p dir=\"ltr\">N.B. for ‘Selected’ promotions you can specify ‘Promotion Conditions’ which must be met in order for the promotion to fire. These conditions specify the quantity of other PLU’s that must be sold before the promotion fires, e.g. you must by two ‘Adult Admission’ PLU’s before you can get 100% discount off a ‘Child Admission’ PLU. Setting up ‘Promotion Conditions’ are covered later.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img width=\"416\" src=\"https://s3-eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/euc-cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/103140259280/original/iJSqdJHazIH1tVi1evcuqo5aZR9ZPvea-A.png?1724338271\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dii\" data-attachment=\"[object Object]\" data-id=\"103140259280\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\"></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p dir=\"ltr\">To select this promotion type, click in the circle to the left of the <strong>‘Discount’</strong> text.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Once you have selected the promotion type, click on the<strong>&nbsp;‘</strong><strong>Next’&nbsp;</strong>button.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Now go to <strong>Section 2&nbsp;</strong>of this guide.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p dir=\"ltr\">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2 id=\"Multi-Buy-Promotion\"><strong><u dir=\"ltr\">Multi Buy Promotion</u></strong></h2><p><br></p><p dir=\"ltr\">Multi-Buy promotions are designed to discount a single item when one or more of that same item has been scanned or entered into the till basket. For example, imagine a café has excess stock of Mars bars and they want to setup a “buy two get one free” promotion on Mars bars. In this example the till software will automatically apply the discount but only if there are three Mars bars in the till basket. This is because the promotion conditions are not met until all three Mars bars have been entered or scanned into the till basket.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><img width=\"604\" src=\"https://s3-eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/euc-cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/103147685919/original/7dXM9pqn6sBLLEdxSd7KiWmSrhnT7YjcIw.png?1726652366\" align=\"right\" class=\"fr-dib\" data-id=\"103147685919\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; border: 0px; vertical-align: bottom; max-width: 100%; position: relative; cursor: pointer; padding: 0px 1px; margin: 5px; display: inline-block; float: none; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; white-space: normal; text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial; text-align: center;\" data-attachment=\"[object Object]\">&nbsp;</p><p dir=\"ltr\">To select this promotion type, simply click in the circle to the left of the <strong>‘Multi-Buy’</strong> text.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Once you have selected the promotion type, click on the<strong>&nbsp;‘Next’&nbsp;</strong>button.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Now go to <strong>Section 2&nbsp;</strong>of this guide.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><br></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><br></p><h2 id=\"Basket-Promotion\"><strong><u dir=\"ltr\">Basket Promotion</u></strong></h2><p><br></p><p dir=\"ltr\">Basket promotions are designed to discount a single item only after another item (or a group of items) have been scanned or entered into the till. &nbsp;For example, a café wants to setup a promotion that discounts a cup of tea by 100% for any customer that orders a breakfast with that cup of tea. In this example the till software will automatically apply the discount but only if both the breakfast and tea are in the till’s basket. This is because the promotion conditions are not met until both the breakfast and tea are in the till’s basket.</p><p><img width=\"604\" src=\"https://s3-eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/euc-cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/103140259277/original/3nontwrkeqUnKQqzrSDURwTuQU9DmbWIDg.png?1724338271\" align=\"left\" class=\"fr-fil fr-dii\" data-attachment=\"[object Object]\" data-id=\"103140259277\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\"></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><br></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><br></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><br></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><br></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><br></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><br></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><br></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><br></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><br></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><br></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><br></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><br></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><br></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><br></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><br></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><br></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><br></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><br></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><br></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><br></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><br></p><p dir=\"ltr\">To select this promotion type, simply click in the circle to the left of the<strong>&nbsp;‘Basket’&nbsp;</strong>text.</p><p>Once you have selected the promotion type, click on the <strong>‘Next’&nbsp;</strong>button.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">&nbsp;</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><br></p><h1 id=\"'Description'-Screen\"><strong dir=\"ltr\">'Description' Screen</strong></h1><p dir=\"ltr\">Now that we have covered the three types of promotions available, we can move onto the next step in creating our promotion. The ‘Description’ screen of the promotion wizard has the following sections</p><ul><li><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Promotion <a href=\"#_Description_Fields\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">Description Fields.&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</span></li><li><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Promotion Group.</span></li><li><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href=\"#_Eligibility_Requirements\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">Promotion Eligibility</a>.</span></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Each of the above sections of this screen are explained in the following pages,</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The location of each of these sections is shown below.</p><p><img width=\"604\" src=\"https://s3-eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/euc-cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/103140259278/original/Nqz0ik4P_nUY-c__HYWXA7otNtNdbzukJw.png?1724338271\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dii\" data-attachment=\"[object Object]\" data-id=\"103140259278\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\"></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><em><u dir=\"ltr\">Key:</u></em></p><p><em>(1) Promotion Description fields.</em></p><p><em>(2) ‘Promotion Eligibility’ options.</em></p><p><em>(3) ‘Promotion Group’ selection (drop-down).</em></p><p><em>(4) ‘Promotion Group’ “Lookup” Icon.</em></p><p dir=\"ltr\">&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2 id=\"Promotion-'Description'-Fields\"><strong dir=\"ltr\">Promotion 'Description' Fields</strong></h2><p dir=\"ltr\">Once we’ve chosen a promotion type, we will need to provide a detailed<strong>&nbsp;‘Description’</strong> as well as a <strong>‘Short Description’</strong> for the promotion being set up. It is important to use descriptions that are easy to understand because they will be used in various places throughout the MStore back office software and when using the till software&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The<strong>&nbsp;‘Description Field’</strong> will show in the relevant reports in MStore back office software.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The <strong>‘Short Description’&nbsp;</strong>field is the description printed on receipts and on the till’s rear display (if present).</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><br></p><p><img width=\"604\" src=\"https://s3-eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/euc-cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/103140259294/original/hqs7JZQbSvcc0EqqmXkLg-_gkhAO52k4NA.png?1724338272\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dii\" data-attachment=\"[object Object]\" data-id=\"103140259294\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\"></p><p dir=\"ltr\">Type in the required text in the<strong>&nbsp;‘Description’</strong> box.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Type in the required text <strong>‘Short Description’</strong> box.</p><p>Click on the <strong>‘Next’</strong> button once finished to proceed to the next step.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">&nbsp;</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><br></p><h2 id=\"Promotion-Eligibility\"><strong dir=\"ltr\">Promotion Eligibility</strong></h2><p dir=\"ltr\">Promotion eligibility is crucial in determining how our promotion will work and unsurprisingly who will be eligible for our promotion. By default, every promotion is set with an eligibility of ‘Everyone’, this means all items associated with this promotion will be automatically discounted when it is scanned into the till basket.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><br></p><p dir=\"ltr\">The major difference between the ‘Everyone’ promotion eligibility type and all the others is that all other eligibility types require the promotion to be activated by a till operator. Meaning the till operator is required to do something that activates the promotion they wish to use (i.e. either press a button on the till or scan a coupon).</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><br></p><p dir=\"ltr\">Please note that if you are setting up a ‘Multi-buy; or ‘Basket’ type promotion, then the promotion eligibility will default to ‘Everyone’ and cannot be changed. For a ‘Discount’ type promotion you must <strong>click in the circle to the left of the required option to select it.</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Each of these promotion eligibility options are explained on the following page.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Once you the required ‘Promotion Eligibility’ is selected, click the <strong>‘Next’&nbsp;</strong>button to proceed.</p><p><img width=\"604\" src=\"https://s3-eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/euc-cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/103140259282/original/5jXuLzSy6jvv7GeOnwmwXdPnXbO35qNxyA.png?1724338271\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dii\" data-attachment=\"[object Object]\" data-id=\"103140259282\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\"></p><p><br></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><u><strong>Everyone</strong></u><strong>:</strong></p><p dir=\"ltr\">This discount will be activated automatically when an item meeting the promotion requirements is added to the basket.</p><p><br></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><u><strong>Members</strong></u><strong>:</strong></p><p>This promotion eligibility can automatically apply a discount when a member card is swiped or scanned at the till.

Please note that setting up till buttons is not covered in this manual but for your information the button that fires this promotion must be set up as a ‘Command’ button action, then select the ‘Staff Sale’ option from the drop-down list. &nbsp;Please note that only <u>one</u> staff discount scheme can be in operation on your tills at any time (on some versions). The specific staff discount scheme must be defined in the MStore back office software in the ‘System Options’ screen.

If a promotion group is not assigned to a promotion, then the discounted items will not be shown in the relevant reports. To set a promotion group we can choose from one of the default groups listed within the drop-down menu, or we can create a unique promotion group by selecting the “Lookup” icon.&nbsp;</p><p dir=\"ltr\">&nbsp;</p><p><img width=\"604\" src=\"https://s3-eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/euc-cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/103140259284/original/qk2WzavHrzrKWAZXalgplGGS5c7g4_PkZg.png?1724338271\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dii\" data-attachment=\"[object Object]\" data-id=\"103140259284\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\"></p><p dir=\"ltr\">&nbsp;</p><p><u dir=\"ltr\">Key:</u></p><p><em>(1) ‘Promotion Group’ selection (drop-down).&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>(2) ‘Promotion Group’ “Lookup” Icon.</em></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p dir=\"ltr\">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h1 id=\"'Details'-Screen\"><strong dir=\"ltr\">'Details' Screen</strong></h1><p dir=\"ltr\">The Promotion Details screen is where we will configure the discount details for all items we wish to include in this promotion.

    "text": "TABLE OF CONTENTS Introduction Creating Non-Stocked Items Setting Up PLU’s that will be Order Options Setting up PLU’s that have Order Options Setting Up ‘Default’ Order Options Sending PLU’s to Kitchen Printers How Order Options Work on the Till Introduction The following document is designed for use in catering environments and covers: Setting up PLU’s for your various ‘Order Options’ (e.g. meal choices such as chips or salad). Setting up PLU’s to have a choice of ‘Order Options’ when sold (including ‘Default’ order options). How to define the kitchen printer a PLU will be sent to. How order screens look and work on the till itself. Please Note: The prerequisite for using this manual is to already have received training on and know how to: Use the ‘New PLU/Stock Wizard’. Use the ‘Price Lookup Index’ to add / find and edit PLU’s (including the ‘PLU Maintenance’ screen). Creating Non-Stocked Items In catering environments, meals that require various options to be selected and sent to the kitchen printer would usually be set up as a ‘Non Stocked Item’. This is because you do not hold e.g. ‘Fish and Chips’ in stock. This is a meal that is cooked to order when it is sent to the kitchen printer, so all meals that are cooked to order would usually be set up as a ‘Non-Stocked Item’ in the MStore software. Likewise, any ‘Order Options’ would be set up as a ‘Non-Stocked Item’. For example, with a main course you may get a choice of either chips, or jacket, or boiled potatoes, each of these would be set up as a ‘Non-Stocked Item’. Likewise, any other cooking instructions that need to be sent to a kitchen printer (e.g. Well Done, Medium, Rare, No Onion, No Nuts etc) would each be set up as a ‘Non-Stocked Item’. The first steps of setting up any ‘Non-Stocked Item’ are detailed below: 1. Click on the ‘Setup’ main menu button. 2.Next click on the ‘Pricing’ button. 3. Now double click the ‘New PLU/Stock Wizard’ button. Select the ‘Non-Stocked Item’ option and then click the ‘Next’ button. You will now see the following screen. First set up all your order option / cooking instructions PLU’s (see below). Setting Up PLU’s that will be Order Options Enter the details in the below screen as required. In the below example ‘No onion’ will be a choice (‘Order Option’) that has no (£0.00) price. Alternatively, an ‘Order Option’ could have a price, e.g. ‘Extra Cheese’ could be £1.00. Enter all the details as required then click the ‘Next’ button. You will now see the following screen. Click the box to the right of the text ‘This is a food item’, so that it becomes ticked. Now click the box to the right of the text ‘Order option item:’, so that it becomes ticked. Once the correct options have been selected click the ‘Next’ button. You will now see the following screen. Enter the required code in the ‘Code / Barcode:’ box, then click the ‘Add’ button. Next click the ‘Finish’ button. You will now see the following message. Click the ‘OK’ button. Repeat the process to create all the zero priced and priced order option PLU’s as required. Setting up PLU’s that have Order Options The following section details how to set up a meal that will have order options, in the example below we will set up the ‘Fish and Chips’ ‘Non Stocked Item’ PLU and show you how to add the ‘Order Option’ PLU’s it requires. Select the ‘Non-Stocked Item’ option and then click the ‘Next’ button. Enter all the details as required then click the ‘Next’ button You will now see the following screen. Now click the box to the right of the text ‘This is a food item:’, so this becomes ticked. Now click the box to the right of the text ‘Kitchen order item:’, so this becomes ticked. Also click the box to the right of the text ‘Order Options’, so this becomes ticked. Once the correct options have been selected click the ‘Next’ button. Enter the required code in the ‘Code / Barcode:’ box, then click the ‘Add’ button. Next click the ‘Finish’ button. You will now see the following message. Click the ‘OK’ button. You will now see the message below, click ‘Yes’ to add the relevant order options. You will now see the following screen. The list of order option item PLU’s you have already created will now show on the left-hand side. You can click and drag the required order option PLU's from the left, to the right-hand side of the screen. This creates the required list of options that will appear when selling this item on the till. To create an “either/or” click and drag the required order option items ABOVE the red line. N.B. the options will appear on the till in exactly the same order that they are added, so please ensure you click and drag the options in the required order. If an order option(s) are in the wrong order, they will need to be deleted and re-added in the correct order. To delete an option from the right-hand side of the screen, click on the item (so it becomes highlighted yellow) then press the ‘Delete’ button on your computer’s QWERTY keyboard. The item will now be removed from the list of selected order options. In the below screen an “either / or” choice has been created. If you want to create a second “either / or” choice, double click ON the red line. This will create a second section ABOVE the red line (as indicated by the arrow above) You will notice that the start of the new section is indicated by a blue line. Simply drag your second choice of order options PLU’s from the left-hand list into this new section. (i.e. you would drag the order option items BETWEEN the blue line and the red line). If required, double click the red line again to create a third section of “either / or” choices. N.B. you can only create a maximum of 8 sections of “either / or” choices above the red line. In this scenario it has been decided that the following “either / or” choices only are required: (i) the first choice will be either ‘White Bread’ or ‘Brown Bread’. (ii) the second choice of either ‘Peas’ or Beans’. If so, then the right-hand side of the screen would be set up to look like the example shown below. Please note that in addition you can also have only one “any of” choice. This is done by dragging order option PLU’s from the list on the left-hand side, but these need to be dragged BELOW the red line on the right hand side of the screen. On the till this means you would be able to select “any of” the items (showing below the red line) Setting Up ‘Default’ Order Options If required, you can also set ‘Default’ order options. These ‘Default’ order options will be automatically selected on the relevant order options screen that is displayed on the till. If you do not want any ‘Default’ choice (i.e. the till operator must ask the customer before selecting the relevant options), then simply do not set up any ‘Default’ choice on the order options. The ‘Default’ order options can be seen and defined here. A ‘Default’ choice can be switched on / off as required. To turn a ‘Default’ choice on, first click in the box next to the required order option item. Next press the ‘Y’ key on your computer keyboard. To turn a ‘Default’ off, first click in the box next to the required order option item. Next press the ‘N’ key on your computer keyboard. Once all the options have been set up as required, click the ‘Save’ button. You will now see the following message. Click the ‘OK’ button. You have now set up the required order options. Please ensure that you send all the changes down to the till(s) via Edit > Recreate Till Data. Sending PLU’s to Kitchen Printers For items that need to be sent to a kitchen printer only, the required set up is detailed below. For example, a ‘White Coffee’ PLU when sold does not have any order options, but needs to be sent to a kitchen printer near the drink preparation area. This would be an example where it is sent to the kitchen printer only. As explained in the previous sections, create a new ‘Non-Stocked Item’ and fill out the below screen. In this scenario simply click the box to the right of the text ‘Kitchen Order Item’, so that it becomes ticked. Click the ‘Next’ button to continue. Enter the required code in the ‘Code / Barcode:’ box. Next click the ‘Add’ button (and the code you entered appears where shown and is highlighted yellow) Click the ‘Finish’ button. You will now see the following screen, which confirms the non-stocked item has been added. Click the ‘Ok’ button. Please note that when you add a PLU using the ‘New PLU/Stock Wizard’ and you tick the ‘Kitchen Order Item’ box, as standard this PLU will be automatically set to send to ‘Kitchen Printer 1’. In the scenario where there is more than one compatible kitchen printer installed and available, then you may need to find the PLU and select the required kitchen printer as detailed below: Go into SETUP > PRICING > PRICE LOOKUP INDEX. Search for and open the required PLU record, so you are in the ‘PLU Maintenance’ screen (below). Select the required kitchen printer this PLU will be sent to. N.B. you can select the PLU to send to, either: ‘Kitchen Printer 1’, ‘Kitchen Printer 2’, ‘Kitchen Printer 3’ or ‘All Kitchen Printers’ as required. Click ‘Save’. Now you must send all the changes down to the tills as usual, via Edit > Recreate Till Data. Next, we recommend you go to the till(s) and thoroughly test all the order options are working correctly. The order options screens on the till are detailed in the next section of this manual. How Order Options Work on the Till On pressing the button to sell a PLU that has order options, you will see a screen like the one below. You will notice that ‘Default’ order options are already selected and are highlighted green. You can select an alternative “either / or” choice by simply pressing / clicking on the required option. You will notice that in the above example an additional order option of ‘No bread’ and ‘No Peas or Beans’ have been added, which will appear on the print outs sent to the kitchen printer. This may be something that you want to set up, if so these are just set up as order option PLU’s. For the “any of” order option choices, simply press / click on these to toggle the choice on / off. You can also enter a ‘Table Number’ and number of ‘Covers’ in the relevant boxes as required. There is also a box in which free text notes can be entered using the QWERTY keyboard. These notes will also be sent to the kitchen printer along with the order options that were selected. Click the ‘Ok’ button and complete the transaction to the required payment method in the usual way. The items will be sent to the relevant kitchen printer(s) as defined in the PLU setting detailed earlier. Please Note: For this to work it does require kitchen printers to have been purchased from and installed by K3. Once installed these need to be assigned to the required tills in the background. Then each till can send to the kitchen printers it is connected / networked to, there can be a maximum of 3 printers per till. But the PLU setting determines which kitchen printer the item gets sent to (kitchen printer 1, 2,3 or all of them). If you want to enquire about having kitchen printers.",

    "text": "TABLE OF CONTENTS Introduction Adding Data Capture to a PLU Selecting the PLU that Requires Data Capture The Data Capture Window Data Type: Capture Prompt Frequency Rules: Adding Data Capture to a PLU Text Capture: Numeric Capture Option List Capture Yes or No Capture Email Capture Online Booking Capture Viewing Captured Data Introduction When selling a PLU or when booking a specific ‘Bookable Resource’, data capture can be used to record additional information that may be required. This could be information such as the nationality of anyone buying an admission ticket at the till, or the age of a child for a ‘Visit Santa’ booking made online. Adding Data Capture to a PLU Selecting the PLU that Requires Data Capture The first step is to find the PLU you wish to add ‘Data Capture’ to: 1. click the ‘Setup’ icon. 2. click the ‘Pricing’ icon. 3 double click the ‘Price Lookup Index’ icon. Find the required PLU using the ‘Prices Index’ in the usual way by entering the search criteria and click 'Search'. Double-click on the required PLU in the 'Search Results' section (bottom half) of the screen. This will open the ‘PLU Maintenance’ window. Click the ‘Add/View Data Capture’ button. The Data Capture Window Data Type: Per PLU you can set a maximum of 5 data capture questions. There are seven “data types” that you can use. These are outlined within the ‘Data Type’ dropdown menu. The 7 data capture 'Types' are detailed below. Text: Prompting for a custom text response. (For example: on birthday bookings you may wish to capture the birthday child’s name) Numeric: Prompts for a numeric input. (For example: to capture ages) Yes/No: Prompts for a yes or no response. (For example: on an online day ticket booking you may ask “Do you want a free guidebook”) Photo: Prompts to capture a photo at point of sale. Option List: Prompts the customer to select an option on the list. (For example: how did you hear about us? Option: 1.Internet 2., TV advert, etc.) Postcode: Prompts to capture a postcode. (used mainly for marketing purposes) Email Address: Prompts to capture an email address. Capture Prompt Frequency Rules: These tick box fields control the data capture behaviour at point of sale. Prompt once per transaction: The data capture will trigger once per transaction only. (regardless of the quantity of this specific PLU are in the basket). Prompt once per unique PLU: The data capture will trigger for each unique (non-duplicate) PLU in the basket. Prompt for each Sales Line: The data capture will fire the number of times this specific PLU is in the basket. Inactive: This option can inactivate the specific data capture question. This question then will then not show in the top half of the above screen, unless the tick box marked ‘Show Inactive?’ is ticked (by clicking the box). Response mandatory: A response must be given to this specific data request to be able to complete transaction. Internet only: All data capture defaults to working at on the till only, this tick box limits the capture to only trigger for online sales of the specified PLU. Please Note: If you want a data capture prompt to appear on both the till and for online sales you would need to create two data capture questions, one with ‘Internet Only’ box ticked. Adding Data Capture to a PLU For this example, using the ‘Santa Grotto PLU’ we’re going to capture: Name of the child: (Data Type: Text) Age of the child: (Data Type: Numeric) Child’s gender: (Data Type: Option List) Do you want a photo: (Data Type: Yes or No) If so, the contact email address where the photo will be sent to: (Data Type: Email) The following sections of the manual show how these would be set up to work on the till. The manual shows in detail what each capture method looks like on the till screen. In the Section 2.4 ‘Online Booking Capture’ there is an image of how data the capture questions appear online. Text Capture: Click ‘New’. Input the prompt text, e.g. what is the child’s name? Using the ‘Data Type’ dropdown, select ‘Text’ Select ‘Prompt once per unique PLU’. Click ‘Apply’ When you sell the item on the till, this is what shows on screen: Numeric Capture Click ‘New’. Using the Data Type dropdown, select ‘Numeric’ Click ‘Apply’ Input the prompt text, e.g. how old is the child? Select ‘Prompt once per unique PLU’. Click ‘Apply’ When you sell the item on the till, this is what shows on screen for this data capture: Option List Capture Click ‘New’. Using the ‘Data Type’ dropdown, select ‘Option List’ Click ‘Apply’. Input the prompt text, e.g. Gender? Select ‘Prompt once per unique PLU’. Input your first option in ‘Add new option’ field (refer to the next page **). Now click the ‘>>’ button. Repeat from the above point (** see page 9) until all options show in the option list as required. (only two options have been added purely for demonstration purposes). Click ‘Apply’. When you sell the item on the till, this is what shows on screen for this data capture: Yes or No Capture Click ‘New’. Using the ‘Data Type’ dropdown, select ‘Yes/No’. Click ‘Apply’. Input prompt text, e.g. Souvenir Photo? Select ‘Prompt once per unique PLU’. Select ‘Response Mandatory’ tick box. Click ‘Apply’. When you sell the item on the till, this is what shows on screen for this data capture: Email Capture Click ‘New’. Using the ‘Data Type’ dropdown, select ‘Email’. Click ‘Apply’. Input the prompt text, e.g. Email address? Select ‘Prompt once per unique PLU’. Click ‘Apply’. When you sell the item on the till, this is what shows on screen for this data capture: Please note data captured in the booking would land in the 'Diary' screen in MStore. Viewing this data is detailed in Section 3 below. Online Booking Capture Please not online data capture is only available to customers who have purchased the relevant ecommerce modules. This is just an example of what the five data captures 'Types' demonstrated in this guide appear like online in a booking. When the ‘Bookable Resource’ is added to the basket the questions pop up as shown below. Any data captured in the booking would land in the 'Diary' screen in MStore and viewing this data is detailed below. Viewing Captured Data Data captured when making a booking appears within the ‘Bookings’ screen for a specific booking. The easiest way to get view a booking is by 1. clicking 'Diary' then 2. click 'Find Bk'. Enter the booking reference in the 'Booking Ref:' field and click 'Search' is the best way to find the booking. If yuo do not have this use other search criteria and click 'Search'. Double click any booking that is found (in the bottom half of the screen) to open the booking record. In the ‘Bookings’ screen, double-click any resource which had captured data. Please note you can see at a glance whether the specific booking has any data capture. Any booking with data capture will have a green bar as shown above, which says: “Double click items below to review responses to data capture questions” The data will be displayed as shown below. If you wish to remove a captured data record, click on it so it becomes highlighted. Press the ‘Delete’ button on your computer keyboard. A message pops up saying, “Delete Selected Record?”. Click the ‘Yes’ button. If you wish to amend the captured data, simply double-click on any line in the above screen. A new window will then pop-up as shown below, in which you can amend / overtype the data. Enter / amend / overtype the data as required and click ‘Ok’. Repeat the process to amend / overtype / delete any other captured data records. Ensure you click the ‘Save Booking’ button to save the changes made.",
