    "text": "The issue can arise if manual adjustments are made or for other reasons the HQ and Store quantities get out of kilter. This can be rectified by performing a full item stock reconciliation. To do this open HQ manager and go to worksheets. Chose 501: Request a full item count. First step Click none to clear all and select the store you want to perform this for. Although multiple stores can be chosen on this worksheet, it is highly recommended doing them one at a time. 1. To avoid confusion 2. The second step explained later will be better served doing one at a time. Click Next You will see the following dialogue box. Ordinarily you can leave this as is and click next. Click Finish Check the details and click Approve. A worksheet will be created. Wait for the store to poll and process the worksheet, (Green flag). Once processed, no changes have been made. It has merely uploaded store quantities to the HQ but not made any changes to the inventory. The next step will allow the changes to be made. This is why it is advisable to do one store at a time. The next step needs to be performed before the store polls again. This is because the worksheet has uploaded quantities as they are now. Once the store polls again, any sales, returns or transfers will not be represented in the uploaded quantities. If you miss this window, the worksheet will need to be run again. Second step As stated earlier, the above worksheet must have been processed by the store. This step MUST be performed before the store polls again, unless they are currently not trading. Otherwise the quantities uploaded via the worksheet may no longer be correct, due to sales, returns or other inventory changes. HQ needs to be in maintenance mode. Go to wizards and select inventory wizard. Click Next Select task 190: Full item count reconciliation. Click Next Select the store you did the 501 worksheet for. You can check the box ( only show discrepancies). I have left it blank as there are no discrepancies on my test data. Click Next. Click Finish. A box will be displayed showing the discrepancies between the HQ and the uploaded store quantities. . Once you click commit HQ quantities will be changes to match the uploaded store quantities. It is not a bad idea to perform this periodically to make sure the data is correct.",

    "text": "Occasionally polling can stall, this results in no data being collected from the stores. The 402 (data upload) worksheet runs every time the store connects and processes sales, transfers as well as other data. If Polling has stalled you will notice that no sales data for the affected stores appear in reports. The first thing to check is that HQ server and Voucher server (if used) are both running and waiting for connection (green arrow). Next check that the worksheets are being processed. In H! manager Go To View / Worksheet status / Store status (as shown below). Flag symbols are as follows. White - unapproved, Green - completed, Blue - not completed but not due yet, Blue with yellow ! - Not processed but overdue. The Blue ones with an ! will be the ones that have not polled. The last polled date is shown. First try restarting HQ server by clicking file / exit on both HQ server and Voucher server. Or by ending HQserver.exe in Task Manager, NB (Voucher server is also HQserver.exe in TM). IMPORTANT!! HQ server must be started first, if voucher server is started first HQserver will return an error when starting and won't start. After restarting HQ and Voucher server and Voucher server check the status of worksheets again as above. If still not polling check HQclient in the stores is running and processing worksheets. In the stores HQclient will be running either on a Back Office PC or Till 1. HQ client looks like this. Check that worksheets 'completed with no errors'. Voucher server looks slightly different and doesn't process worksheets as such but facilitates global vouchers. When all completed and working Worksheet status looks like this.",
