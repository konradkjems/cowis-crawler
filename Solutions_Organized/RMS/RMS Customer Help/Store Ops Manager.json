    "title": "Offline batches -Blind Closed",
    "text": "When an RMS till goes into offline mode, the current batch is Blind Closed by the system. If the till is used in offline mode the these transactions go into a separate batch in the offline database. When the till is back online (reconnected to the primary database), this batch too is uploaded to the server and blind closed. The transaction from that point forward go into a new (3rd) batch and trading continues as normal. When you come to Z read at the end of the day only the transactions from the point the database was reconnected will show (3rd batch). In order to balance the till, it will be necessary to X and Z read these blind closed batches. To do this follow the following instructions. First of all exit POS, this is because POS holds the printer and the X and Z reads will not print if the printer is help on to by POS. Open SO manager. Go to Journal / Update batch info. Click OK on the dialogue box that appears, there is no need to enter any filters. Find Blind Closed batches in the list. The below image only shows open batches as I do not have any blind closed batches currently. Open batches are current batches being worked, these can not be X or Z read here. To process the batches Double click on the batch number. This will bring up the options below. Whether you need to enter Opening and Closing amounts depends on your current settings. When you have Z read all of the batches for the day in question. These Z reads can be added to the totals from the main Z read to balance the till. Please remember that if POS is still open and you process the Z read, the Z read will not print but it will process the bacth and it will no longer be available in this list. There is nothing we can do to get it back, so please make sure POS is exited before this process is undertaken.",
