    "text": "All configuration is completed through the Sync application. This is the application that is launched when you select Start > All Programs > Retail Technology Ltd > RMSify. Alternatively, it can be launched from Headquarters or Store Operations Manager through the menu Utilities > Addins > RMSify. Initial configuration is performed through the installation wizard which takes you through the same configuration screens described in further articles, but in a more structured way. The wizard only appears on first launch. There are rules as to where you can edit the configuration, and these work in line with the supported topologies described in the Introduction. Standard Headquarters – All configuration is performed in the Headquarters database. Changes to the configuration are transmitted to the processing store through a Worksheet 51. You will not be able to open the Sync application at the processing store. Store Only Headquarters – Once the wizard is run and you have told it you are syncing from the processing store, all configuration will need to be performed at the processing store. If you want to change back to a Standard Headquarters topology, you launch the application at Headquarters and make the change there. Single Store – The configuration can be run on any computer which has RMSify installed. To access the configuration settings, click Options > Settings from the RMSify menus. Any machine which is going to run the Web Orders tool MUST have the Sync application launched once before the Web Orders “Custom POS Button” will work. Any change made in RMSify in a Headquarters database will be automatically transmitted to stores through a Worksheet 51.",
