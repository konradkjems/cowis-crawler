Whilst data syncing is in progress, you will see a progress bar for each section of the sync that it has to perform. Each of these are detailed later in the user guide. Log The log section of the screen shows you useful information about the sync process, allowing you to see exactly what is happening during data synchronisation. If you double click an error in the log, it will show you the full details of the error, which can often be much more helpful when deducing the cause of the issue or warning. If you need to send these log files to K3 for analysis, then use the Help > Send Logs menu. Sync Section This area lists the different Shopify fields which RMS can sync with. These make use of the field mappings which are defined in the configuration. At any time you can see what field is mapped to it by hovering the pointer over the field name. To Shopify This column allows you to pick which fields you want to update in Shopify when you press the Sync button. It will only update fields in Shopify which have a check in the box. Cells which are shaded out are “required” fields that you can not toggle, so will always synchronise with Shopify. From Shopify This column allows you to synchronise data back from Shopify into RMS when you press the sync button. It is designed so that you can make the most of Shopify’s WYSIWYG editor and apply rich formatting to your product description and product pages. Cells which are shaded out are “required” fields that you can not toggle, so will always synchronise with Shopify. Sync Buttons When one of the relevant Sync buttons is pressed, data will be syncronised between RMS and Shopify in the direction that you choose. Only fields which have a check in the box will be synchronised. They will only synchronise new or changed data. Go To Webstore This button takes you directly to the administration area of your Shopify web store. You will still need to log in using your registered username and password. If you are using the Multiple Web Stores feature, the button will take you to the administration page of the webstore selected in the Sync drop down box. Choose Web Store If you are using the Multiple Web Stores feature, then the Sync screen has a drop down box listing the web stores you have configured. Pressing the Sync button will sync data for the web store selected in this box only.",

The application will automatically connect to Shopify and download orders when the Web Orders button is pressed in the POS, so there is no need to click the Web Orders button and then immediately click the Get Web Orders button. If you have more than 20 open web orders pressing ‘More Web Orders’ will then download the next 20 open orders to the list. Additionally, once Web Orders has been opened the first time in the day, it will check for Web Orders automatically for you in the background, every 5 minutes. If it finds an order, it will tell you. If you restart your computer, you will need to click the Web Orders button again the first time to restart the automatic web order download process again. If you are using the Multiple Web Stores feature, pressing this button will retrieve orders from all web stores which this store has been configured to process orders for. For more information, please see section 4.9. Apply Date Range By default when you open Web Orders the Apply date Range option is unchecked and will download the 20 latest orders from your web store. Pressing More Web orders will then download the next 20 open orders from Shopify. Using the Apply Date Range option you can grab the open orders for a specific date. This will use the From Date and To Date to determine what to download and will grab any order created between 00:00 on the From Date up to 23:59 on the To Date. To Apply a Date Range check the Apply Date Range checkbox and enter the dates followed by pressing ‘Get Web Orders’. This will refresh the web orders list to show any open orders between these dates. Please note the date range settings are saved so when you exit Web Orders and reopen it will apply the previously set date range, if on the next open you want it to grab All open orders ensure before closing the Web Orders box you uncheck the Apply Date Range option.",
