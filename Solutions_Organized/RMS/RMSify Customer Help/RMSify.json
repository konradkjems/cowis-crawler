The add-in must be installed through the Shopify App Store, and you must have a valid Shopify account in order to install it. It’s easily found by searching for “RMSify” at http://apps.shopify.com The software itself is a single installer which can be used anywhere in the RMS estate. There are no different installers for Headquarters, Store or POS as there are with other integrated solutions. It’s one simple package which can be installed wherever you need to run it. The package consists of 2 components. RMSify Sync – This is the application which synchronises your product data between RMS and Shopify, and is also where all settings are configured. RMSify Sync can either synchronise data from RMS to Shopify, or the other way round – from Shopify into RMS. This can be run on a Store Operations database or a Headquarters database and it will automatically detect which it is and behave accordingly. This is usually operated from a “Back office” computer. RMSify Web Orders – This is the application which runs on the till and allows the process of Shopify Web Orders through the RMS POS interface. It retrieves outstanding orders from Shopify to allow a “Picking List” to be printed to your receipt printer. Once picked, it imports the order as a standard POS transaction and allows you to tender the transaction as per RMS. It then notifies Shopify that the order has been shipped. It can only be launched through a Custom POS Button and therefore can only be run on an RMS Point of Sale. As already discussed, RMSify can be used in Store Operations and Headquarters, or a combination of both. Here are the supported topologies which you can deploy RMSify to. Standard Headquarters – This scenario is when product data is synchronising from the Headquarters database. All web orders must be processed through an RMS POS, and you must choose which store is going to be used to process your web orders. You can optionally choose which “on hand” figures you want to use in Shopify – Either the quantities from the store you selected as your web store or the total of “on hand” quantities from all of your stores. In this scenario, it is not possible to run Sync and Web Orders on the same physical computer. Store Only Headquarters – This scenario is when your store is part of an RMS Headquarters chain, but product data and web orders are all processed through a single store as part of that chain. This is not recommended, as any product data amended at store level is liable to be overwritten by an RMS Headquarters Worksheet. In this scenario, only local store inventory data is used for your Shopify inventory levels. Single Store – This scenario is when you have only one RMS store. Both RMSify Sync and RMSify Web Orders run from the single store database.",

    "text": "RMSify allows you to automatically create transactions for Shopify Web Orders in RMS. When enabled, you must ensure that RMSify Automatic Web Orders is running on your Web Store POS. When running, Auto Web Orders will check for new orders from your Shopify store every 5 minutes. When an order meets the set criteria (i.e. Fulfilled/Paid) RMSify will automatically create a corresponding transaction in your RMS database for the Web Order. This setting gives you the flexibility of allowing you to fulfil your orders through the Shopify admin panel but still track and amend stock in your RMS system to ensure inventory levels are as accurate as possible. This setting can be enabled in the RMSify Sync Settings under the rules tab and enabling \"Automatically Create RMS Transactions\": Once enabled, you'll need to decide when you want RMSify to create the transactions by setting the \"Create Transactions When\" option: When set to Fulfilled, RMSify will automatically create a transaction in RMS as soon as you mark the order as fulfilled in Shopify. RMSify will still commit stock on orders that haven't yet been fulfilled and committed stock will be released when the transaction is created in RMS. When set to Paid, RMSify will automatically create a transaction in RMS as soon as the order in Shopify is marked as Paid. Stock will typically not be committed in this instance as orders will typically come through as 'Paid' immediately. This means that the transaction will be created almost instantly and instead of being set to committed, the stock will be removed from your on-hand quantities You'll also need to select your preferred cashier to be assigned to the transactions in RMS. This drop-down will list all cashiers listed in your RMS database. Finally, you can specify a register for the transactions to be created against. Web Order Transactions will be posted into the currently open batch on the specified register. When enabling this setting in a HQ environment, RMSify will automatically create #51 Worksheets to update your nominated Web Stores settings. You'll need to ensure these worksheets are processed to ensure Auto Transactions is enabled at the Store level. Like Transactions, you also have the option of automatically creating returns. Auto returns will identify any orders that have been refunded or partially refunded and process a corresponding return in RMS. Important note: When this setting is enabled, the stock for any refunds will be sent back to your on-hand quantities. If you aren't receiving the stock back you'll need to ensure to manually adjust the stock accordingly. Auto Transactions can be enabled without Auto Refunds but Auto Refunds CANNOT be enabled without Auto Transactions.

    "text": "Sometimes you may be required to set a custom running time for your RMSify Automatic Stock Updates. Since the function of the stock sync is to update Shopify with stock sold in your brick and mortar store it is best practice to run your Stock Updates during trading hours only or if in a HQ environment, only for the duration that your Stock Source stores are polling. By default RMSify only allows you to pick from certain timing options for your schedule: You can change the timings more granularly by editing the Scheduled Task itself in Windows Task Scheduler. To do this: Open Windows Task Scheduler. Find your RMSify Stock sync (this should be called \"RMSify_StockUpdate\") and double-click into it to open the proerties. Navigate to the 'Triggers' tab and edit the current trigger: Set your start time to be your opening time: Enable the 'Repeat Task every:' option and set the frequency to your desired amount: When selecting a duration you'll notice the drop-down only includes set amounts. You can add any duration you wish by simply typing into the text field. It may be tempting to run the schedule as frequently as possible. However, this can actually be detrimental. Best practice when choosing a frequency when running in an RMS HQ environment is to match your 401 worksheet frequency. This ensures HQ has the latest stock figures and isn't updating Shopify unnecessarily. Another consideration is the amount of items included in the stock sync. Typically we would recommend not running your stock sync more frequently than 1 hour. In the below example our trading hours would be 09:00 - 18:00 and the stock sync will run on the hour, every hour between those times: Click 'OK' on all open windows to save your changes.",
