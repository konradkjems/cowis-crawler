We advise you schedule the stock to be updated automatically (see below) however you can update it manually at any time by right-clicking the RMSify icon in the bottom right hand corner by the clock, and clicking “Update Stock Quantities” If you are using the Multiple Web Stores feature, it will update the stock quantities for each defined web store, one at a time. In order to maintain accurate stock levels, its important that these are updated as frequently as possible and appropriate for your business. RMSify can perform this task for you automatically. Click Tools followed by Scheduled Stock Update. RMSify uses a Windows Scheduled Task to do this You can choose whether or not you want to make use of this feature through the Enable check box. Checked means it will run, unchecked means it will not. You can choose how often it is repeated too. By default it is selected as Daily, which means it will run the stock update at midnight every day. If you were to choose a different option, it would run every n minutes throughout the day. If you are using the Multiple Web Stores feature, it will update the stock quantities for each defined web store, one at a time. If you wish to set up more advanced settings, you can edit the properties of the relevant Windows Scheduled Task. K3 does not support the execution and advanced configuration of scheduled tasks as this is a core windows feature. For more help in configuring a scheduled task please contact your support partner.",
