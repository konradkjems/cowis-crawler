Impact Urgency Environment/Hardware Details Customer's Own Reference Number Product Name Product - Version Requestor's name How to Create a Ticket A ticket can be created by emailing support@k3btg.com as well as phoning for emergencies (see What is the phone number for Support?) To start the process of creating a ticket on the portal, simply click the Submit a Ticket button on the top right of the menu. This is the best option as explained in You're here, but why use the portal? Information Required to Create a Ticket Below is an explanation of each field you see on the portal. Not all fields are necessary, but the mandatory ones are marked with a red asterisk. . Remember, the more you help us by providing lots of information, the more we can help you. Requester The requestor is automatically populated with your email address. Please do not change this. You can add other people to be notified/copied on the ticket, but they must be a registered contact in our system (otherwise the email address is ignored/removed) Subject Subject should be a short meaningful summary of the request. Site Name Select from the list of sites/stores which we have on record for your company. If the location is not listed, then please select the last option \"zz Not Listed...\" and include the site name in the ticket Description box so that we can add that site, and update the ticket. When you submit your first ticket from the portal, the Site you use is set as your default. This means that each time you submit a ticket after this, your default Site will be automatically selected, but you can change the Site for that ticket by selecting from the dropdown list. Description of Request If the request is an Incident (something's not working as expected), please include a description of what the issue is with screenshots if applicable, upload any files, is it replicable (does it always happen, or just sometimes), and how this is impacting you/the company. If your request is for us to help you with something, deliver something, or a feature/configuration request, please provide as much information as you can. Ticket Category This is very important so we understand if you have a problem which needs fixing, or if you need help, or want something else from us. The Service Level Agreement (SLA) only Incidents which are K3's responsibility (K3 software or hardware fault if you have a contract for us to provide support), but we will do our best to respond to the other types within similar timescales as well. Incident Select this category if something's not working as expected. This might be a suspected software bug/fault, or hardware fault etc, but this can be defined in the Sub-category dropdown list. Service Request Select this category if you want us to help you with something or deliver something to you Change Request Select this category if you would like us to consider a change to our software (otherwise known as a Feature Request), or change your configuration (might be chargeable). Sub-Category The list of sub-categories will change depending on what Ticket Category you have selected. This helps us to understand the type of request and route/prioritise it correctly. Impact and Urgency What Are They and Why? The Impact and urgency are described below. They are used to calculate the priority of a ticket. Details on this can be seen in How quickly can I expect my ticket to be dealt with? Please do not be tempted to assign all tickets a High Impact (for Incidents only) and High Urgency unless you have a whole site unable to trade. Impact This dropdown list is only shown if the Ticket Category is \"Incident\" because an impact is only really felt when something doesn't work as expected. Urgency Urgency reflects how quickly this needs to be investigated/delivered. Environment/Hardware Details If your request pertains to hardware or the IIT environment/infrastructure which the hardware is in, please provide us details here to keep this information separate and clear for everyone. Customer's Own Reference Number If you have an IT system where you have logged an issue or request before logging it with us, you might want to put your IT system reference number in here to help you match them up. Product Name This is to tell us the name of the software, or perhaps \"Other\" if you have purchased something other than software from us (e.g. hardware only or hardware support). if you have only purchased one product from us , the Product Name will be pre-populated with that product. If you have purchased more than one, you will need to select which one from the dropdown list Product - Version If you know the version of the product (for non-cloud software only because cloud software is always on the latest version which we install), and it's relevant to the ticket, please let us know to speed up our investigation. Requestor's name If you are using your own email address to login to the portal, you do not need to enter anything here. If you are using a store/site generic email (or a manager's email, or any email address which is not just fir you), type your name in here so that you and us know who raised the ticket to avoid confusion if someone else reads the email etc",

Feedback on Knowledge Base articles There are two ways in which you can communicate directly to the Support team to help us improve, or tell us when we've done well :-) Feedback on Resolved Tickets When certain types of tickets are resolved, the email notifying you will ask you to complete a very quick satisfaction survey - just a few clicks unless you want to add a comment as well (which is very useful if you choose one of the \"Extremely\" ratings). Once you click on one of the above, you will be taken to a screen which looks like the below. As you hover your mouse over the dots under the extra two questions, you will see the possible ratings change (same options as for the main question). What Do K3 Do With the Feedback? The Support team have Customer Satisfaction (CSAT) targets which are personal and for the whole team. The whole K3 team have access to reports to review the CSAT ratings and trends so that they can react to them. Managers are automatically emailed if there are any \"Extremely Unsatisfied\" ratings, and regularly review any comments added by customers. Comments really help us take action in response to ratings, whether it be issues, or praising staff or teams for their excellent customer service. I Clicked the Wrong Rating - How Can I Correct It? If you click the wrong rating by mistake, and what to correct it after you've submitted it, just go into the ticket on the portal (you might need to set the filter on the right of the Tickets page to show your resolved tickets) You will see an option to \"Rate us again\" which will open the original ticket rating screen for you to select your choices again. Feedback on Knowledge Base articles Every knowledgebase article has the following at the bottom of it: If you click \"Yes\", then we will know that this is an article which is useful, so we will make sure that it is updated when necessary so it's kept in place for you and other customers in future. If you click \"No\", you will be shown the below so you can tell us what needs improving in the article (or maybe another article needs to be written by us)",

    "text": "TABLE OF CONTENTS Why your support is limited and what to do next What is “Support on Stop”? ⚠️ Why might support be on stop? 1. Commercial Hold (Unpaid Invoices or Contract Issues) 2. Outdated Software Version ✅ How to restore full support Need help? Why your support is limited and what to do next Most ticket statuses should be self-explanatory, but if your ticket is set to \"Support On Stop\", what does it mean? To ensure we deliver fast, effective support for all customers, we operate a Support on Stop policy in specific (rare!) circumstances. This article explains what it means, the reasons it may be applied, and how to restore full support. What is “Support on Stop”? If your organisation is placed into Support on Stop, it means that some, or all tickets will be placed on hold until the issue is resolved. This means that the SLA timer will be paused. You’ll be notified via the Support Portal if your ticket is affected. ⚠️ Why might support be on stop? There are two main reasons your organisation may be placed into Support on Stop: 1. Commercial Hold (Unpaid Invoices or Contract Issues) If there are outstanding payments, expired agreements, or other commercial concerns relating to your contract, your organisation may also be placed into Support on Stop. K3's Finance team determine when a customer are put on hold for this reason, and when they are taken off hold. 2. Outdated Software Version For some on-premise (non-cloud) products, e.g. MStore, if the version you have is more than 12 months old, you will be placed on Support on Stop until your system is upgraded to a supported version. Priority 1 and 2 faults, and non-software related requests are still dealt with as normal Staying up to date ensures access to new features, improved stability, and quicker issue resolution. To schedule an upgrade, please raise a request via the Support Portal: Service Request → Software Delivery Request For MStore, you can see more in What versions of MStore are supported? ✅ How to restore full support To resume full support, the underlying reason for the hold must be resolved: For commercial holds: Settle outstanding invoices or resolve contract issues with your Customer Success Manager. For software version holds: Upgrade to a supported version of MStore. Once resolved, support for all ticket types will be reinstated. Need help? If you're unsure why your support has been limited, or you’d like help getting back on track, please contact your Customer Success Manager.",
