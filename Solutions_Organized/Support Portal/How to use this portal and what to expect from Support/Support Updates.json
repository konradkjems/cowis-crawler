    "text": "We have reflected on the past year as well as looking forward to the new one. We have reviewed the customer satisfaction feedback many of you have provided (requested by email when we resolved tickets), and looked at our support system statistics after its first full calendar year in operation. Here are our key achievements and what we are going to change in response to your feedback which includes faster resolution targets and more phone access to the Support team. For MStore customers, there's more good news in MStore Support Update January 2025. Fast Resolution During 2024, we resolved Incidents (faults/issues) 79% faster on average than the Service Level Agreement (SLA) targets. The full results can be seen on UK Support Stats for 2024. We have therefore decided to: Upgrade (free of charge) the Incident Resolution SLA We will aim to provide an even faster service as shown below. Phone Calls To and From Support We’ve had feedback that some customers feel that Support do not use the phone as a channel to help customers. During 2024 we: Answered 1,347 phone calls which lasted 9 minutes, 31 seconds on average for new issues being raised. Made 3,306 calls out to customers, lasting an average 6 minutes, 2 seconds. If we feel that the best way of resolving a ticket is by talking to you, we will! During the year we have consistently requested that customers to only phone us for situations where a location is unable to trade (i.e. a Priority 1 fault). This keeps the phone lines free for such emergencies for all of our customers. We have also integrated our support system with Microsoft Teams during the last year, which also means that any P1s raised directly by you via the portal are instantly messaged to the entire UK support team, so the portal is now just as fast as the phone and can enable you to provide better quality information about your issue (e.g. screenshots, error messages, etc), and reaches a wider Support audience immediately. Based on your feedback we have decided to now accept phones calls to Support for both P1 and P2 issues for customers on the Standard SLA agreement, and P1, P2 and P3 issues for customers with a Premium SLA agreement. We are adding more people to the phone lines to manage this, but the choice is now yours – the portal may still be better to send us detailed information, and see what may be already available to help you within the knowledge base articles. We hope that these improvements will help you in your daily use of our systems and services, and encourage you to provide feedback on support tickets as often as you can to help us to continue to make further improvements in how we support you in 2025 and beyond. Note that Extended Hours support remains for P1s for (contracted customers) only",

Historically, we have not charged the time and effort to implement upgrades if the upgrade is to fix a fault, and if the upgrade is undertaken in normal business hours. For 2025 we are introducing that every customer can have the one free of charge upgrade per year (during normal business hours). This will enable you to take advantage of all the latest features that have been developed and will keep your system up to date. Upgrades during normal hours to fix significant faults will continue to remain free of charge. IF your current version of MStore is more than 12 months old, we would encourage you to request an upgrade because older versions cannot be supported to the same level as current versions. A full explanation can be found in What versions of MStore are supported? User Guides Updated and Searchable! We have been working hard to update our user guides, as well as provide regular recorded Webinars to help our customers get the best out of the extensive feature-set which MStore provides. In February, we will be replacing the current k3btg.training website with full product user guides maintained by the product development team in the Freshdesk support system This means that you’ll be able to search the guides for information and, when raising a support ticket, the AI in our Support system will search the guides for you to find potential resolutions or answers to your questions – all in one place. We hope that these improvements will help you in your daily use of MStore and encourage you to provide feedback on support tickets as often as you can to help us to continue to make further improvements in how we service and support you in 2025 and beyond.",
