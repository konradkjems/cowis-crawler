    "text": "On the main interface of DdD POS, as shown in the below screenshot, you can see different information regarding a store. It can tell us if the POS is a RIAB POS and to which DdD server it is connected. Moreover, it also shows us the client id including terminal number for that store and which version of the POS program is currently running on the POS. Sometimes, due to internet instability in the store, the POS is not active in communication with DdD API and all data from the POS is not sent to Backoffice in that case. It is important to notice all the times, that the POS is in fact communicating with DdD server. An example is shown below where no DDDWEB with a specific number can be seen. In that case, the solution is to restart the POS programme and it can be done by simply writing RESTART in the clerk field. After restart, you will observe that the POS is now connected to the DDD webserver again.",

The customer screen has a single cable that it needs to be plugged into, cable is shown below: As shown below, the customer screen only has 1 port, this is where the cable goes. On the POS itself, the cable goes to the port thats similar to the one on the customer screen, it is highlighted below: Once the cable is plugged in, and the customer screen attached, the POS and customer screen are assembled and ready for use.",

If there is still an open inventory (you cannot start a new inventory if the previous one has not been completed), it must either be updated or, if the inventory is older than 1 year, deleted. ATTENTION! To delete, you need to be logged in with a user with a password. Otherwise you cannot delete the inventory data. (To setup a password for a user, please click here.) Update: Delete: Start Inventory Sign into the POS and click on the DdD button Under Inventory, click Start Inventory Set date for Update as at and Inventory as at, choose Inventory type Total and click Start. Scan the articles with the inventory scanner. Click Empty Scanner and then press 9 on the scanner to start the transfer of data. ATTENTION! If the scanner won't transfer the data to the PC, this can mean that the scanner cradle is not connected to the right COM-port. This is not a question of which physical USB port it is connected to, but rather which COM-port Windows has given the scanner cradle. The cradle must always be connected to COM7. If you don't know how to change this, please call our support hot line or read more here. Usually, it takes about ½-1 hour for the data to be transferred to Backoffice. It can take longer if other shops are running inventory at the same time. Click Order Inventory List. If the list is empty, the data is still in transit. Add corrections if you have any. You can order as many inventory lists as you wish as long as the inventory is still active. As soon as it has been updated, you can no longer order these lists. Once you are satisfied with your inventory, you need to order the closing print before you can update and thereby complete your inventory. Click Order Inventory List again and tick Closing print, then click Order ATTENTION! It is advisable to wait until the closing print has turned up and you have either saved or printed it before you update and thereby close your inventory, as you will not be able to order another printout once the inventory has been closed. Now you can update your inventory by clicking Update and entering the code \"status\" in the Inventory code field and thereby close it.",

If you have a \"closed\" remote warehouse or something similar, this can be counted in good time before \"Stock count per.\" (well before the final stock count). It is not a requirement that you count immediately in connection with \"Stock count per.\", but for practical reasons it will probably always be a good idea (\"If you count in the morning before opening, choose the date before. If counting after closing time today's date is selected”). It is not a requirement that the two dates are the same. You can easily choose to count in the middle of January (Stock count per) and update with effect on the last day of the previous year (Update per). I would think many do. Of course, the loss from the first days of the new year is carried back to the previous year. Inventory format: Normally Total. Be careful when choosing Variants or Catalog items.

    "title": "Labels information adjustment in Backoffice",
    "text": "When a clerk prints a label from a label printer, It can happen that labels informaton is shifted. It means that the text and barcode printed on the labels are either moved horizentally or in vertical direction. IT is possible to adjust the settings in Backoffice and can try different offsets and choose the right settings that should work for a label.The default offset should be between 0 and 90.The correct offset needs to be find out by trying changing values for offset lodret and offset vandret. I am sharing two examples below where it can be observed in the first one that the information is on the topmost end of the label.It means we have to change vertical values (offset lodret) that can move the label a little down. In this case,the offset lodret value was changed from 60 to 40 and the print out should be on perfect location. In the Second example it can be observed that the label needs be adjusted vertically up and we should increase the value in offset lodret.In case we have a value 20 so we should change it to 40 and check again how it looks. The procedure to change the values in Backoffice is as: Login to Backoffice select Program Menu Select Maintenance Select LabelOpsætning In the screenshot above,Alm.Stregkode is used to change the information on the barcode etc. Udsalgsprismærker is selected if information needs to be updated only on the sales labels. After saving the changes/new offset values, A reload must be executed in ekspedient bar on POS in order to update it on the POS. Repeat the procedure if the text/information needs to be adjusted more on the label.",

In such case,there is a possiblility to order an invoice report by checking the option with Update Status(5). This report shows information about all invoices being received on a particcular date and whether it has been updated in the system or not. An example is shown below. The report generated will show all information regarding the supplier,item group,invoice information and its update status. As shown below,it also shows which system user in backoffice has actually updated the items. In this case,the backoffice user 1 with name Assistance has updated the invoice 253451 on 03/04/2024. It also helps to track who in the store has updated a particular item/invoice and on which date.",

Instead, you need to run the attached program (FixSaClient.bat) to correct whatever problem SaClient is experiencing. Download the program onto your desktop and run it. You may need to run it as Administrator (right-click on the program and choose Run as administrator).* Click Y to the question asked (only necessary if you run the program as an administrator. Otherwise, it will just run and shut down the below window again within seconds.) It is a good idea to briefly turn off the printer and turn it on again and refresh the browser window.

If you are still experiencing problems, please raise a ticket through our Support Portal and we will contact you. ___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ *In some cases, this window appears after you have clicked \"Run as administrator\".

    "title": "Missing receipts/notes in Backoffice",
    "text": "Are you in doubt about whether all receipts/notes have been transfered to Backoffice (if e.g. there is a difference in Finance Report you can't explain), you can start with ordering a transaction report (either in Backoffice or on the POS). The receipt/note numbers have to be continuous per store with the one exception of the cash balance note (if this is done at the end of day), which is not shown on the list (see the below example, where receipt/note number 48296 is not shown in the report at the end of the day, because it is the cash balance). When you have gone through the report and found missing transactions, you can transfer them yourself if there aren't that many of them. You can only transfer one at a time if you do it yourself. If it is a question of many, then please create a ticket on our portal, citing whic receipte/note numbers are missing (attach the report) and the case will be forwarded to our development team. If it is a matter of a few receipts/notes, open the POS and in the shop assistant field type \"export XXXXX\" and click the green button as in the example below. The missing receipt/note will now be transfered to Backoffice. The POS will not acknowledge the transfer in any way and you will have to be a little patient, as the transfer speed depends on how busy the system is. After half an hour / an hour you can order a new transaction list to check if the receipts/notes hae turned up.",

If you want to set an approximate date and stick to that or you want to manually change the exchange rate whenever it changes is up to you Suppliers with Euro prices: Attention!!! You have to create Euro under Currencies before you can use it under Suppliers. If you have a supplier, who uses EURO instead of British Pounds, you can create another version using EURO. Exsample Supplier Lenette (already exists and has been created with British Pounds as Currency. You cannot change the currency on an existing supplier) You then create a new supplier (called e.g. Lenette EURO) with the same information, except for changing the Currency to EURO. If it is a new supplier who only uses EURO, you just create them as a new supplier with EURO as currency.",

To be able to make the setup we need to go through the following steps: AgreementGrantToken To enable us to send data to Economic, we ask you to follow the link and return the resulting code to us: https://secure.e-conomic.com/secure/api1/requestaccess.aspx?appPublicToken=bTdCvYFj4PtI8GMehfbrRWMeZLDlvpMluaTWb86z85U1 2. Accounts Together with this letter you should have received an Excel document in which you are supposed to write account numbers and possibly counter account numbers for the payment types and item groups that are used in the shop. A counter account is typically used for costs, money from POS to bank, and cost of goods sold. If you want a specific setup for each shop and/or range of POS’es you can just create new tabs in the Excel document, each containing a copy of the “template”, and fill in account numbers. The Excel document should be returned to us. 3. Test When the setup has been made we will send data for a given period to Economic. The purpose of this is to correct errors and misunderstandings. 4. Auto When testing is finished we will start the automated generation of data. This means that every night you should get data from the past day. Resending of data for a given period of time is always possible. However, we will have to send data for whole days and for at least one shop in the setup. This meaans that it is not possible to send data for a single POS or a payment type/item group that had been missed in the original setup. We expect the following returned from you: Name of draft in Economic (We will send data to the draft): AgreementGrantToken (text string, rather not a picture): The filled in Excel document/documents",
