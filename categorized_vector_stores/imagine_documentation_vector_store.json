A Dimension Template is where you have one or several Dimension Names or sets. You can set up a variation of Dimension types such as Colour, Size, weight or an alternative. Dimension Template Group - This is the Dimension Group title where the Dimension Values sit within. Dimension Value - Is the value information of size, age, weight or any other value of which an item is distinguished. Below are some examples of Templates, Names and Values setup for easier selection when creating items.

    "text": "Certainly! Here are the steps to add items to the stocktake: Step 1. Find the stocktake you want to work with from the drop-down menu. Step 2. Once you have selected the stocktake, click on the \"Count\" button to begin the counting process. Step 3. Ensure that you have selected the correct partial blank stocktake by checking the message displayed on the screen. This will open a counting page where you can add items manually or import counts from a file. If you choose to import from a file, refer to the separate section on File Import for instructions. Step 4. Enter the physical section you are currently counting. You have the option to add counts in individual sections that reflect how you break down the count within the shop. For example, stockroom, gondolas/stands, display windows, cupboards, etc. If you are importing, the sections may be based on the import file. You can select and modify these individual count lists later before completing the stocktake. - If you leave this field blank, all counts will be shown under the header of \"Default\" in the Count drop-down list. Step 5. Enter the barcode of the item you want to add. You can either scan the barcode or manually enter it into the barcode box. Once selected, a default quantity of 1 will be added. - Alternatively, you can manually search for an item using the \"Find Item Manually\" option. You can search by text, vendor, or item groups. Once selected, a default quantity of 1 will be added. Step 6. The \"Total Number of Unique Barcodes\" field displays the number of entries in the stocktake. Step 7. The \"Total Counted Quantities\" field shows the total number of counted quantities. Step 8. If you want to deduct the quantity when an item is added via the barcode entry, set the \"Negate Quantity\" option to \"Yes\". Step 9. For a Partial Blank stocktake, set the \"Add Items Not Currently in Stocktake\" option to \"Yes\" if you want to add items that are not already included in the stocktake. If set to \"No,\" no items can be added. Step 10. To manually search for an item, follow these steps: - Enter the search text, which can be a whole word or use an asterisk (*) before or after the word to search for all possibilities. For example, \"can*\" for candles or \"*proof\" for waterproof. - Use the drop-down menu to select one or more vendors from the list. - Use the drop-down menu to select one or more item groups from the list. - Click the \"Search\" button to start the search process. The results will be displayed in the list below. These steps will guide you through the process of adding items to the stocktake and manually searching for items within the stocktake.",

Scan or manually enter a barcode to count items, or use the \"Find Item Manually\" option to search for items and adjust their count quantities. Each time you scan a barcode, the quantity is increased by 1, and the most recently scanned item is displayed in the \"Last Scanned item\" box. You can manually adjust the quantity in the \"Last Scanned item\" box instead of the Manual Count list before moving to the next item. Alternatively, if you are adding items directly from the item list, you can use the \"+\" and \"-\" buttons or directly choose the quantity field to adjust the count quantities. the quantity is limited to a maximum value of 10 digits (e.g., 9999999999) and up to a maximum of 2 decimals (e.g., 99999999.99). The minimum value is 0. Step 3. You can use the \"Items by page [5 10 20 50]\" and the \"Page number [7 of 11 (54 items)]\" to scroll through and find more items in the list. Step 4. Once you have added all the counts, choose the \"Back\" button to close the count page. All counts are automatically saved. Step 5. If you entered a description into the Physical section box, it will appear in the Count list. Step 6. Use the drop-down menu to see all counts and select a specific count. Step 7. To add more individual counts with different physical descriptions, choose \"Count\" again from the top right-hand side (Step 3) and add a different physical description. Note: To amend a specific location (e.g., Location 55G), choose \"Count\" again from the top right-hand side (Step 3) and type in the same description again. It must be the same to update the existing count location; otherwise, it will create a new count location. These steps will guide you through the process of manual counting, adjusting quantities, and navigating the count page.",

    "title": "PoS",
    "text": "The Imagine PoS system is a Point of Sale (PoS) solution that operates directly within modern HTML5-compatible browsers. It is specifically designed to function seamlessly both online and offline, leveraging the advanced capabilities of contemporary browsers and a distinctive hardware platform. This eliminates any worries a retailer may have about potential connection issues. While the system provides a reliable offline functionality, retailers should consider investing in a dependable LAN (local area network) and Wi-Fi infrastructure, which may include backup connections such as mobile network cut-over, if there is a desire to maintain an uninterrupted and continuously accessible service. The Point of Sale system operates on a supported browser and device, requiring an Internet connection. This connection can be established through either Wi-Fi or a wired LAN connection. However, if you are using a fixed PoS system rather than a mobile device, it is recommended to utilize a wired connection for enhanced stability. The PoS system interacts with a web-based database in real-time, allowing it to read and write data seamlessly. Coupled with the database, all business logic acting on this data is also held and processed in cloud based computing. To mitigate outages the PoS system has incorporated an offline failover function, enabling you to continue trading even in the absence of an Internet connection. To facilitate the connection between the hardware components (such as PoS printer, cash drawer, PIN entry device) and the system, a device called a \"Connector\" is employed. The Connector must always remain connected to the local network via a wired connection. Online mode requires the Connector to be connected to the Internet too. In the event of offline working, where the shop has no access to the Internet, then the browser and Connector work in tandem on the LAN to allow continuous transactions recording and printing. Offline working is jointly handed by features of the browser and Connector and is reliant on the LAN being active. The configuration of the Connector is managed through the POS Admin, which operates within the Imagine Portal. When initially running the device, the Connector needs to be online to establish a connection with the server and download its configuration and offline data. However, once this initial setup is completed, the Connector can operate either online or offline. It is strongly recommended that the Connector is keep online where possible as offline data can become out of date where item details are altered in Inventory. It is important to note that if there is no local connection between the browser device and the Connector (due to a router or local network being down), you will be unable to communicate with the hardware or conduct offline transactions. This also applies to PIN Entry Devices (PED's) that must be on the local connection in order to function.",

You can also directly enter a receipts barcode here, or the Matrix code for a range of variant items (see Matrix Lookup below) The POS will automatically detect input from an external source, such as a keyboard or a barcode scanner. However, if you want to use the soft keyboard, tap the Enter barcode box and you will be able to tap a barcode number. Browsing and searching for an item Click the browse button to perform a search. This will take you to a list of products where you can directly scroll through the items and select using the Cart button.

When you tap the search box the soft keyboard will appear. Enter a description and it will perform a smart search, looking for the values you type. It will separate words by a blank space and search for combinations of these words. When you have found the item and you want to add it to the transaction, you press the Cart button If you want to print an item details label instead of adding it to the transaction, press the Print button This will open the left side tray where you can enter the quantity of labels required and choose which label design to print.

In the example below the selection is Colour-Pink and Size-M. Once you have made the selection tap OK to confirm and you will return to the transaction screen and the item line will be listed. NOTE: Tapping Cancel will return you to the transaction screen. You can now finalise the transaction.",

    "text": "TABLE OF CONTENTS Introduction Receipts Settings Selecting Gift Aid Items POS Customer Capture Transactions Introduction Gift Aid is a UK scheme from HMRC where eligible organisations such as charities can accept donations instead of payments and claim the equivalent of the donator's income tax relief. This works by capturing a customer’s details at the POS when they wish to purchase a qualifying item. This data is then exported and submitted to HMRC to claim tax relief for the donation. How it works When an item marked with a Gift Aid attribute is sold via the POS, a prompt is displayed to confirm if the customer would like to give Gift Aid to the organisation. If Yes is chosen then the required customer detail is captured and the value of the transaction will be recorded for HMRC. On a periodic schedule, these transactions are exported to a spreadsheet and submitted to HMRC, usually via a dedicated portal for Gift Aid. Your accountant will be able to further advise on the submission process. For full details of Gift Aid rules see HMRC Gift Aid Receipts Editing Customer Declaration for Gift Aid The customer declaration is printed on the POS during a Gift Aid transaction. The wording of the declaration can be edited in Gift Aid - Receipts. Click Save when editing is complete. Settings Creating a Custom Attribute for Gift Aid To identify items for Gift Aid a Customer Attribute is needed. In Inventory - Customer Attributes create a new custom attribute. The custom attribute should be created as type Yes / No, it should be left as optional. Give the Custom Attribute a code and name that identifies it as a Gift Aid custom attribute. Note the code for use on the Gift Aid Settings page. Identifying the Custom Attribute for Gift Aid Items are identified as Gift Aid items via a custom attribute. Under Gift Aid - Settings the custom attribute specifically designated for Gift Aid should be selected so this can be applied to items. From the drop-down select the Yes/No Custom Attribute made for Gift Aid use. Selecting Gift Aid Items In Inventory - Item List chose or create item(s) that are to be Gift Aid Items. Select the Gift Aid Custom Attribute as part of this process to identify the item as a Gift Aid item. In the matrix tab ensure the Gift Aid custom attribute is enabled (set to Yes) At least one item is required a the POS to perform Gift Aid transactions, but you can nominate more than this if desired. POS Customer Capture On transaction payment, when item(s) marked as Gift Aid have been included in the transaction, a prompt will be displayed, asking if the customer wishes to Gift Aid their eligible purchase. Choosing No will allow the transaction to continue without further processing or capturing of Gift Aid data. Choosing Yes will request the required customer details. These details are required by HMRC to satisfy the Gift Aid transaction export. On completion, the receipt and declaration will be printed. If during this process the customer changes their mind then the 'I have changed my mind' button should be pressed and any details will be discarded and the transaction will continue as if the No button had been selected initially. NOTE: there is no validation at this stage that the customer details are valid. The clerk should ensure reasonable details are entered and formatting of details like Postcode are correct. Transactions Exporting Gift Aid Transactions Transactions are exported via the Gift Aid - Transactions menu. The transaction list will be displayed and can be filtered to a specific date range. Transaction rows can be expanded to view detail. Export Data Clicking the export icon will download transactions for the date selected as a .xlsx sheet. If any dates have already been exported then a warning will be displayed but transactions can be downloaded multiple times. You should be careful not to declare a Gift Aid transaction to HMRC more than once.",

    "text": "NOTE: SCOs are named Units within the Self Serve Companion. When accessing the Self Serve Companion, you will find a list of all the Units that are currently online for your shop. In the context of the Self Serve Companion, a Unit is considered online when the SCO app is running inside a browser. It is important to note that if a machine is powered off, the browser is closed, or the browser is not on the SCO web page, the Unit will not be reported as online in the Self Serve Companion. Colour Coding The Self Serve Companion utilizes a basic color coding system that works in conjunction with the NCR SCO Tri-Light color system. Here's an overview of the color codes and their meanings: Green: This color indicates that there are no obstacles or issues preventing the user from completing a transaction smoothly. Orange/Amber: When a Unit is displayed in this color, it signifies that a supervisory action will be required soon in order for the customer to proceed with the transaction. Typically, this occurs when there is a need for approval due to a restricted item. Red: The red color indicates a hard block, meaning the customer cannot continue with the transaction at all. Immediate action is necessary to resolve the issue. In addition to the color coding, each Unit will present a message that provides further information to complement the status color. These messages serve to provide more context or details about the current status of the Unit. Status Messages Ready The Unit is ready for the next customer. No action is required. Needs Arm Setup The Unit in the Self Serve Companion will provide information about the status of the SCO's connector. Each SCO is expected to have one associated connector. If no connector is selected for an SCO, the Unit will indicate that it \"Needs ARM Setup.\" For further details regarding the connector setup, you can refer to the POS Admin - K3 Connector Manager, which provides more comprehensive information on managing connectors in the system. Help When the customer presses the Help button, the SCO will be blocked and the Unit will show in Red. Item Not Found When a barcode is scanned that cannot be recognised, it will block the customer from proceeding so they do not accidentally add the item into their bag without paying. Restricted Items In the Product Configurator, items can be restricted in two ways. Firstly, an item can be flagged as \"Age Restricted,\" which requires the clerk to determine if the customer is legally allowed to purchase the item based on their age. Secondly, the quantity of items that can be purchased together in a single transaction can be restricted using the \"Restricted Quantity\" field. When a restricted item is scanned, both the Tri Light and SCO Companion will display an orange status. This indicates that although it doesn't block the customer from proceeding with the transaction, it presents an opportunity for the clerk to remotely approve the restriction. By approving the restriction promptly, the clerk can facilitate a faster checkout process for the customer. If the clerk does not catch the orange alert in time, the SCO will block the transaction when the customer press the pay button and the SCO will force an authorisation. The clerk needs to press the Authorize button to remotely authorise the transaction.",

    "text": "TABLE OF CONTENTS POINT OF SALE CONFIGURATION ANALYSIS CONFIGURATION TENANT CONFIGURATION INVENTORY Global Configuration Management allows you to configure settings that will impact all of your shops, meaning that these options apply across the whole of your tenant. Once you have made the necessary changes, ensure to click the \"Save\" button to apply and retain the modifications. It's important to note that if you leave the page without saving, the changes will not be preserved. POINT OF SALE CONFIGURATION Please note that the default setting for this feature is disabled (unchecked). If it is not enabled, the Point of Sale (POS) will not execute these actions. However, if you enable (tick) this option, the POS will perform the following actions when a barcode is scanned. For barcodes that have exactly 18 characters, the last 6 digits represent the item's new price. The first and second numbers are swapped, as are the third and fourth, but the fifth and sixth numbers remain in the same position. For instance, if the barcode is \"123456789012123456\", the price of the item is \"2143.56\". If the 6th character in an 18-character barcode is \"9\", the POS will use the following 6 characters as a search query to match against the item numbers in the item list. For instance, if the barcode is \"123459111111000000\", the POS will initiate a search to find the item with an Item Number of \"111111\". ANALYSIS CONFIGURATION Global Configuration Management is linked to the output of rows for the Analysis module. The default amount of rows 10000 (Ten Thousand) The minimum number of rows is 1000 (One Thousand) The maximum number of rows is 10000000 (Ten Million) If you choose a value outside of these parameters, you will be shown a warning TENANT CONFIGURATION The Serial Number Mask specifies the serial number format. When a serial number or item barcode is scanned or entered manually, its format is checked against the Serial Number Mask to identify whether it is a serial number, item number, or none of these. If you wish to use this feature you should check the Enable Serial Number Tracking option. SERIAL NUMBER MASK EXAMPLES 1. If your serial numbers consistently have the same format (e.g., always 18 characters long and begin with the number combination 50361), you should set the Serial Number Mask to \"50361?????????????\". This ensures that all serial numbers will start with \"50361\" and be 18 characters in length. 2. If your serial numbers always start with the same number combination (e.g., 50361) but have varying lengths, you can represent this format using \"50361*\". This means that all serial numbers will start with \"50361\" and can be followed by any number of characters greater than zero. 3. If all your serial numbers have the same format and are always 12 characters long, you should set the Serial Number Mask to \"????????????\". This indicates that all serial numbers will have 12 characters with no specific prefix or suffix. 4. If your stock items are from different manufacturers who use different serial number formats, and your serial numbers do not have a consistent format in terms of characters or length, you should set the Serial Number Mask to \"*\". This indicates that serial numbers can have any combination of characters and lengths. INVENTORY Allow Placed purchased orders to be changed Please note that the default setting for this feature is disabled (unchecked). If it is not enabled, editing Quantity and Cost in Purchase Orders that have a status of 'Placed' will not be possible. However, if you enable (tick) this option, PO's with a status of 'Placed' will allow you to alter Quantity and Cost values.",

    "text": "TABLE OF CONTENTS Summary details Copy Master Item Additional Information The Summary tab allows you to view and edit the Master Item Information. A Master Item identifies a range of items (or variants) that are linked by a common theme. Master Items are not physical items that can be sold, they logically link variants together. For example you sell T-shirts in a range of colours and sizes. The price, cost, vendor and other details are the same across these items. The Master Item shown on the Summary tab is the link between these variants. The Matrix tab will show specific details for the range of colours and sizes you physically stock and sell the T-shirt in. Summary Header This is made up of the Item Name and Master Item Number, as shown on the Item list. In the example here Hand Bag is the Item Name and 10003 is the Master Item Number. Images See the How to use the Image Media Library article for details about managing an item's images. Summary details Return to the Item List page. Ensure any changes are saved before returning to the Item List. This saves all information belonging to the Master Item Summary tab. Name This is the Master Item Name. Used by the Item List and by parts of Imagine where the items are listed at Master Item level instead of variant level. Manufacturer Item No This is the manufacturer item number at the Summary level. Note: This can be different at a variant level. Default Label Template This is the label format which will be used for label printing unless an alternative format is selected at the time of printing. Active This is where you can set an item to be Active or Inactive. At the summary level, this is for all variants that belong to the item. To make individual variants active or inactive, use the option on the matrix tab against the variant. An inactive item may be excluded from certain parts of the system. Inactive items can be made active again at a later date. Previous Vendors This field shows the previous Vendors that the item was assigned. For reference purposes. Type This is to distinguish if this item is stock or sample. Description This field is an extended description of the Name field and is commonly used to hold more descriptive information about a product, such as material type, weight, size, artist information, design notes, etc. The Description can be different at a variant level. Variants This shows how many Active and Inactive variants belong to the Master Item. Clicking on the Edit Pencil on the right will take you straight to the Matrix tab where you can view and edit the variants. Sales Price Range This shows the highest selling price and the lowest selling price of the variants within the item. If only one price is shown, then all items are the same selling price. Last Cost Range This shows the highest and lowest cost of the variants for the item across all shops. If only one cost is shown, then all items are that cost. Copy Master Item This is a quick way of creating an item based on an existing item, especially if most of the field information is the same. After choosing Copy Master Item you will be prompted for a new Master Item number. Fill in as required or if left blank, it will use the next available system item number. The green Copy Master Item button will create a copy of the item. When you copy an item, it is important to give it proper attention. Specifically, you need to make adjustments to the Item Name field on both the Summary and Matrix tabs. The original Item Name will have the prefix [Copy] added to it. Additionally, remember to modify any other fields as necessary. Helpful Tip: To easily locate the copied item, simply type the word \"Copy\" into the search bar. Additional Information After creating an item, any modifications made to the Summary tab will only apply to the Summary tab itself. If there is a corresponding field on the Matrix tab, it must be separately updated, as these variants can have distinct information based on colour, size, etc. The fields that should be amended separately on the Matrix tab include Manufacturer Item Number, Vendor Number, Image URL, Name, and Description.",

    "text": "The Matrix tab shows detailed information about specific Variant items. Every item in Imagine is a variant, with an associated master item, even if there is only one variant item. Variant items (often referred to as just 'variant') are the physical items you sell in your shop such as an XL blue T-shirt. Master items group similar variant items together such as all T-shirts irrespective of size or colour. Variant item details are shown here whilst master item details are shown on the Summary tab. Note: ensure you click the Save button after making any changes in the Details section. Changes will be lost if you navigate away without saving Images See the How to use the Image Media Library article for details about managing an item's images. Dimension See the Matrix Tab - How to Add and Edit Dimensions on an Item article for details about managing an item's dimensions. Name This is the variant item's name used to identify it within Imagine, such as where the items are listed or selected. This name can be the same across variant items, master items and other items so consideration should be given to ensure easy identification of individual items when viewing data across multiple items. Weighted Average Cost Range Shows the weighted average cost for the item in the tenant and given as a range across all shops where the first figure is the lowest weighted average cost across all shops and the last figure is the highest weighted average cost across all shops. Weighted average cost is the only method used in Imagine to calculate profits, cost sales and margins. Sales Price This is the default retail selling price of the variant item where a specific Local Price is not available. Note: the Sales Price remains unchanged across all shops irrespective of an individual shops currency. This should be taken in to consideration if Local Prices are not available. Last Cost Range The Last Cost is the most recent cost recorded for an item during a receive process, such as Goods Received, Transfers (including inter-company transfers), or any other receipt of stock. As costs can be shop and currency dependant, Last Cost Range is shown as a range from lowest to highest cost and shown in tenant currency. Barcodes This shows all barcodes assigned to a variant item. To add a barcode, key in the number and press the return key on the keyboard. To remove a barcode, click on the \"X\" to delete. Vendor Cost The vendor's own catalogue cost for an item. This is used as the default cost on POs when ordering the item. Shown in tenant currency. Manufacturer Item No This is the Manufacturer's Item number at the variant level. An example of a Manufacturer Item Number is ISBN number for books, or PLU's for fresh goods. This can be different from the Summary Manufacturer Item number and the other variants items. It can also be different from the Vendors Item Number. Tax Code This is the Tax Rate applied when the variant item is sold. Note: The tax rate can be different for each variant. If there are multiple Tax Groups, select a Tax Rate from each group as required. Only one tax rate can be chosen from each group. Tags A Tag is a piece of information that can be attached to an item, mainly for reference or reporting purposes. They are similar to the Custom Attributes on items but express a range of values rather than a single fixed attribute. Key in the value and press return to build up a list of Tags for the item. Previously entered Tags are shown to help avoid duplication or close alternative tags. Vendor Item No This is the Vendors own catalogue number, which can be different to your variant item number. Used by the vendor to identify the item required on a PO. This can be different between variants in the same Master Item. Editable via Vendor Management, see below. Sales UOM Code UOM is a Unit of Measure by which an item is sold, for example weight, length, pack size. UOM can be different for each variant. Note: this field is for reference purposes only. Description This field is an extended description of the Name field and is commonly used to hold more descriptive information about a product. Examples can be material type, weight, size, artist information, design notes, etc. Note: this field may appear as the item's variant description in some parts of Imagine. Description can be different at Summary level as well as across other variants. Restock Level This is the maximum amount of stock to hold for the variant item, and can be different for each variant. This is used to Auto Populate POs. See Purchase Order for more details. This detail is also shown on the Stock Lookup Summary tab. Reorder Point This shows the lowest amount of stock to be held for an item and at which point the item requires ordering. It is used to Auto Populate PO's, see Purchase Order for more details. Reorder Point detail is also shown on the Stock Lookup Summary tab. The Reorder Point value can be different for each variant item. Primary Vendor Each variant item in Imagine must be associated with one or more vendors. Where an item is only associated with one vendor this vendor is by default the Primary Vendor. This field displays the variant item's primary vendor. Where an item is associated with more than one vendor you must nominate one vendor to be the Primary Vendor. This Primary Vendor is the vendor used in selections such as Purchase Orders and reports. To manage vendor for a variant item use the Vendor Management function. See the Vendor Management section below. Active This is where you set a variant item to be Active or Inactive (known as its 'active state'). Other variants will not be affected by the change in active state here, but the Summary item will have its active state altered to ensure consistency, using the following rules: If the Summary item and all variants are inactive and one variant is made active, the Summary item is made active. If all variants are made inactive, the Summary item will be made inactive. To make all variants inactive or active, use the Summary tab option. An inactive variant may be excluded from certain parts of the system. Inactive variants can be made active again by using the Show Active option in Item List. Shortcut When set to ON, the variant item is shown as an Item Shortcut on the PoS. When set to OFF, the variant item is not shown as an Item Shortcut on the PoS. By default, Shortcut is set as Off. This value can be set per variant item. Vendor Management A variant item can be associated with one or more vendors. Each item must be associated with at least one vendor and where this is the case this vendor is classed as the Primary Vendor. Where an item is associated with two or more vendors then one vendor must be nominated as the Primary Vendor. Vendor Management gives you the ability to manage these associations as well as other key information that is relevant to an item and its vendor. The Primary Vendor is the default option within Imagine where vendor/item relationships are required. For example, when making a Purchase Order a vendor must be chosen. The range of items then displayed for this Purchase Order is taken as all items where this vendor is the primary vendor. By having more than one vendor you can switch to an alternative vendor where the current primary vendor may not be able to supplier you this item. Select a vendor from the drop down and click Add to add this new vendor to the list of Available Vendors. Search this list by typing in relevant letters of the vendors name, this will narrow the list of vendors shown. Vendor Item No This is the Vendors own catalogue number, which can be different to your item number. Used by the vendor to identify the item required on a PO. This can be different between variants in the same Master Item. Primary Vendor Toggle on or off as required. Only one vendor can be the primary vendor and there must be a primary vendor. To change the primary vendor to this vendor, edit the vendor line, check the Primary Vendor box and click Save. The Primary Vendor will move to this vendor. Min Order Information only field of the vendors minimum number of these items a vendor will accept on a purchase order. Pack Size Information only field of the number of items in a pack. For example the vendor supplies boxes of pencils that come as 50 in a box. You should order based on this pack size i.e. multiples of 50 such as 50, 100, 350, 5000 etc. Cost The cost at which the vendor will supply the item, expressed in the vendors accepted currency. Tax The tax rate attributable to this item Edit the related line Save changes made to this line Revert changes to this line Delete the vendors association with this item. Only applies to vendors that are not selected as the primary vendor. This does not delete the vendor, only the association. Rest all values to zero",

    "title": "How to Use the Image Media Library",
    "text": "TABLE OF CONTENTS Upload Image Image Library URL Image The Imagine Image Media Library serves as a platform for uploading, storing, organising, and assigning images to your items. To add or remove an image associated with an item, follow these steps: Click on the Add button. This action will reveal the Image Media Library, where you can manage your images. The Image Library displays the images you have uploaded, which can be assigned to items. If you haven't uploaded any items yet, you will need to add some images to the library before proceeding. To access the Image Library, click on the Add button. This action will open a pop-up window with the following tabs: Upload: Allows you to upload new images to the library. Sort: This enables you to organize and sort your existing images. Assign: Allows you to assign images to specific items. Settings: Provides access to additional settings and preferences related to the Image Library. Please note that these tabs will be visible once the pop-up window appears after clicking the Add button. Upload Image To add an image to the Image Library, you can either drag and drop the image file into the indicated area or click on the marked area to browse for an image. Accepted file types for the images are as follows: .jpg, .png, .jpeg, .gif, .svg, .webp. You can select any image files with these extensions to upload them to the Image Library. Image Library The Image Library displays the images currently stored in your library. To delete an image from the library, follow these steps: Select the image(s) you want to delete by clicking on them. Once the desired image(s) are selected, click on the \"Delete\" button. This action will remove the selected image(s) from your library. Please note that deleting an image from the library does not delete it from any associated item(s) that have already been assigned to it. URL Image If you wish to include a link to an image that is located outside of Imagine, kindly provide the URL in the designated space below and select \"Import.\" Please note that since the image is stored externally, if it is ever deleted or becomes unavailable, we will be unable to display the image within the Imagine app. To select an image and highlight it in green, please click on the image(s) you wish to associate with your item and then click \"Add.\" Remember that the same image can be assigned to multiple items. The primary image, which is displayed as a large image, is determined by the order of the thumbnail stack. To change the primary image, simply drag the desired image to the leftmost position in the stack. The large image will then reflect this change. If you want to remove an image associated with an item, select the corresponding image thumbnail and click \"Remove.\" Please note that this action will only remove the association between the image and the item, and the image will still be available in the Image Media Library. The image itself will not be permanently deleted.",

Clear the search bar of any search terms ready to make a new search. Do not show inactive items in the search results. Show inactive items in the search results. Start the search. The Enter button on the keyboard will perform the same action. This will bring up a list of options to add or remove columns. Name This is the Master Item Name. Item Number This is the Master Item Number. Hierarchy Name The Name for the item as shown in the Hierarchy Tab. Hierarchy Code The Code for the item as shown in the Hierarchy Tab. Primary Vendor(s) The Vendor shown here is the primary vendor most often associated with variants across the Master Item. Where there are even numbers of 'most used' Primary Vendors then the vendor shown here is the most used primary vendor that was first associated with an variant in the Master Item. i.e. the longest associated, most popular Primary Vendor. Sales Price The Selling price of an item. If there are different selling prices between shops the lowest and highest sales price are displayed. For example: If Shop A = 20.00, Shop B = 17.00, Shop C = 25.00 and Shop D = 20, the range is 17.00 : 25.00 as Shop B being the lowest and Shop C being the highest. On-Hand Range The lowest and highest stock figure of the item over all shops. For example: If Shop A = 3, Shop B = 5, Shop C = 55 and Shop D = 20, the range is 3 : 55 as Shop A being the lowest and Shop C being the highest. Total On-Hand The total stock over all shops. Manufacturer Item No This is the manufacturer item number at the Summary level. Unit Cost The lowest and highest Cost Price range, displayed in the tenant’s base currency. Item List Search You can use symbols or words in your search to make your search results more precise. Some other common search techniques are: Exclude words from your search Put - in front of a word you want to leave out. For example, car -seat will exclude results that include seat Search for an exact match Put a word or phase inside quotes. For example, \"car\" will only show results with car Wildcard search Put * before or after the search string. For example, ca* will show results where ca is the beginning part of the word like carpet, case, caterpillar, cabinet as well as car. Can use at the beginning of a set of letters too like *ar to find bar, jar, star as well as car",

    "title": "Adding Items to a Receive Goods",
    "text": "TABLE OF CONTENTS Manually Via a Purchase Order There are two ways in which items can be populated on to a Receive Goods, manually or via Purchase Order. Manually: you add each item as needed to the Receive Goods via barcodes or lookups. Via a Purchase Order: you are able to pick a Purchase Order to link to your Receive Goods. When you do this the list of items on a Receive Goods will taken from the linked Purchase Order. Manually To Add items manually to a Goods Receive you must not have selected to receive from a purchase order, that is, on the Receive Goods the Purchase Order field is not populated with a Purchase Order Number. Add by barcode: Ensure the Add by barcode field is selected and then scan a product barcode. On recognising a know barcode this filed will add the item to the grid. If the item already exists, the quantity will be incremented by 1 for each scan. If the barcode is not linked to an item then you will be prompted that no item was found. This field will only recognise barcodes as listed in the Barcodes field on the item matrix tab. You can type the barcode rather than scanning it if you do not have a barcode scanner available. Lookup button: Use the \"Lookup\" button to display the Add Items window. From this screen, you can search for items based on any item's properties. By entering a quantity or using the +/- buttons to increment the quantity, you can populate the grid. Once you have set the quantities for all items, select \"Add Items\" to include them in the Receive Goods. Via a Purchase Order To populate a receive goods from an existing purchase order, follow these steps: Select a vendor: Choose the desired vendor from the available options. Choose the Purchase Order drop-down: Click on the Purchase Order drop-down menu to view the list of available placed purchase orders. Select a purchase order: Once you have chosen a purchase order, the item grid will automatically be populated with the items to receive, and the quantity will be pre-set based on the purchase order. Note: over-receiving quantities on a purchase order are only allowed when the \"Allow over-receive of PO\" setting is enabled in the Shops Details section of Back Office. If this option is not enabled, over-receiving is not possible. Note: it is not possible to add additional items within the Goods Receipt Note when it is linked to a purchase order. In such cases, a new goods receipt or purchase order must be created to receive items that are not already listed in the original purchase order. Note: once a purchase order is placed, it cannot be altered, except where the \"Allow Placed purchase orders to be changed\" option is enabled in Portal Configuration. This allows the Quantity and Cost values only to be altered.",

Gift receipts and gift labels are specialised receipts that allows customers to buy items as gifts, providing a convenient way for both gift givers and recipients to handle returns or exchanges while maintaining the element of surprise regarding the item's price. Gift receipts and gift labels do not identify the price of an item directly. Gift Printing Options: To modify the type of Gift Receipt or Label, select the desired option from the dropdown menu. Print gift receipt Will only print a gift receipt to the receipt printer Print gift label Will only print a gift label to the label printer Print gift receipt and gift label Will print both a gift receipt and a gift label If you need to print one or both options, ensure that the relevant options are available to the Connector to avoid unexpected results. For more information on compatible hardware, please refer to the POS Hardware documentation. Once you have set all your preferences, click Save to apply the changes. You will receive a confirmation message upon successful saving. Gift Label Template: If Print Gift Label is selected you will need to select which Label Template to print from the drop down menu. Select default exchange period type: To set up the Default Exchange Period, choose from the drop down menu. You can choose between Number of Days or Until Specific Date. This will change the type of Default Exchange Period accordingly. Number of Days If your returns policy specifies a specific number of days for the return of goods from purchase, select this option and set the Default Exchange Period in days as required. Until specific date You can choose a specific return date if required, this can be useful Christmas return periods for example, where your customers can make returns up to a specific date irrespective of when they purchased the item. Default exchange period: The Default Exchange Period can be either a date or a number of days, depending on the period type you have chosen. For instance, if your return policy specifies a 30-day window from the date of purchase for most of the year, you would select \"Number of Days\" and input \"30\" in the \"Default Exchange Period (in days)\" field. However, during the Christmas period, you may choose to accept returns from 1st January to 15th January, in which case you would need to update the \"Select Default Exchange\" period type to be 15th January. This information will be displayed on the Gift Label when printed. Voucher Settings The settings here relate to Gift Vouchers, which are also called Gift Certificates. See the Gift Vouchers section in Back Office for more details of set up. Gift Certificate Expiry This is the amount of days from purchase that the Gift Certificate will be valid for. After this date the Gift Voucher will expire automatically. Credit Note Expiry This is the amount of days from issue that the Credit Note will be valid for.

    "text": "Introduction To configure the Expansion Framework, go to Admin > Expansions Module. Usually, your K3 representative will handle this setup if needed. The Expansion Framework allows for the setup of third-party extensions, which can be hosted outside of the Imagine platform and triggered during specific instances within the Imagine App transactions. Expansions can offer diverse functionalities beyond what Imagine already provides. The Expansion Framework is mainly intended for Self Serve and Simple POS applications. Typical Uses The Expansion framework in the Imagine App can trigger events at specific points during a transaction, like before payment. When an event is triggered, a unique identifier is sent to a third-party API to identify the session and the basket. Imagine will provide a window for external services to interact with the user and wait for a completion message. Third-party applications can perform custom actions, such as collecting additional information from the user or directly interacting with the Imagine basket object. Expansions allow for additional functions that may not be accessible or relevant to the retailer. For example, a retailer may require a specific feature for their shop, but K3 needs to set up and configure it. The Expansion framework allows the retailer to enable or disable the feature independently. Furthermore, if Clean Cash is enabled for the tenant and shop, the retailer can enable or disable it in this section. For more information about when Clean Cash can be temporarily disabled, refer to the Clean Cash notes. The Expansion framework is primarily available for Self Serve and Simple POS applications. Expansion Selection To begin select the shop/location. To enable an expansion, simply select the desired expansion and toggle the switch to the \"on\" position. Once you have made your selections, click on \"Save\". After saving, you should receive a notification that says \"Expansions was updated successfully\".",

NOTE: If you leave the Stocktake section your items will be saved and will be restored when you return to scanning. When performing an Ad Hoc count, you will be asked to start scanning or searching for the goods to be counted. Firstly, you will need to select the location from the drop-down menu and tap continue. When a line is scanned/selected it will be added to the count and will display the quantity on hand. If necessary, you can alter the quantity by pressing the line you wish to alter. You can use the - or + buttons or use the Numpad to input the new quantity. Press Continue to add to the stock check. NOTE: You can review previous counts and edit quantities if an error is made. Scans are timestamped and grouped by a configurable parameter. So, when you scan items with the same barcode they will be consolidated. When a count has been completed (if you have the correct permissions) it can be reviewed and submitted to Imagine, however, quantities are not adjusted at this stage. You will need to use Imagine to commit the count. To remove an item from the stock take list, swipe the line to the left and press the bin icon to remove. When you have finished scanning the items, use the top right-hand corner to finish. You will be asked to confirm the submission of the stock count. You will get a confirmation of the stock take submission and the number of lines within the stock take. Scheduled This is used for stock takes that need to be performed on particular dates. NOTE: If you leave the Stocktake section through the device controls such as a gesture or O/S button then your items will be saved and will be restored when you return to scanning. If you leave the Stocktake via the Companion App ‘Back’ button then you will asked if you would like to preserve the stock count or not. When you select a Scheduled Stocktake you will be shown a list of stocktakes that are either Open or Counting. Note: Calculating, Calculated, Closed, Committing or Creating stocktakes are not shown on the Companion App. Once a stocktake is chosen you will be asked to enter a Count Name. A default Count Name based on the current date and time is given. You should enter a Count Name in line with your stocktake procedures. If you click Cancel you will be returned to the list of stocktakes as a Count Name is required to continue into the counting screen. You will then be shown a list of expected items to be scanned on the Stock take. If you scan an item that is not expected in the stock take you will hear an audible beep and a notification will display. Once the correct item is scanned it will be added to the list. NOTE: you can edit the Count Name here using the ‘pencil’ edit icon If necessary, you can alter the quantity by pressing the line you wish to alter. You can use the - or + buttons or use the Numpad to input the new quantity. Press Continue to accept the updated item count. NOTE: You can review previous counts and edit quantities if an error is made. Scans are timestamped and grouped together, meaning when you scan items with the same barcode they will be consolidated in to a single line and the Count will be updated as necessary. When a count has been completed (if you have the correct permissions) it can be reviewed and submitted to Imagine, however, quantities are not adjusted at this stage. You will need to commit using Imagine. To remove an item from the Stocktake list, swipe the line to the left and press bin icon to remove. When you have finished scanning the items, use the top right-hand corner to finish. You will be prompted to either Add to existing counts, Replace existing counts, or Cancel. Add: counts will be added to any existing counts in Imagine to give you a stocktake Quantity. The Quantity tells you the total stock of that item in your shop Replace: counts will remove matching items from any current counts and this count will be the single value that makes up your stock Quantity in your shop Cancel: will return you to the list of stocktakes, preserving the current count You will get a confirmation of the stocktake submission.",

    "text": "The PoS Admin - Button Management menu should be used in preference to this menu, Admin will be removed in future releases and will not be accessible Button Management, in conjunction with Clerk Roles, allows you to manage the enabled or disabled state of a button for a group of clerks. In the POS Admin section, Button Management enables you to control access to specific POS functions at the shop level. On the other hand, Clerk Roles allow you to control access to POS functions for groups of clerks. Please note that Clerk Roles take precedence over Button Management settings. If a clerk does not have a role set, the button's state will be determined by the settings configured in Button Management. In both Button Management and Clerk Roles, many buttons are labelled with text. In such cases, the button option to enable or disable will correspond to the button label shown on the POS. However, if a button is displayed with an icon only on the POS, this documentation will provide a representation of the button and its location to help you navigate to the correct option. The POS layout consists of different sections, and understanding these key areas will aid you in selecting the appropriate button to manage: 1. Header: This section displays notifications, date, time, and store/clerk information. 2. Receipt: Here, you interact with items for sales and perform other functions within the POS. 3. The Receipt Item Line: This refers specifically to the Receipt screen when you have added an item to the POS, excluding Item Group, Expense, Gift Certificate, Account Deposit, or Set. 4. Widgets: The functionality of Widgets can be enabled or disabled by your K3 representative, account manager, or support staff. 5. Right Menu POS Function: This section allows you to interact with day-to-day functions within the POS that are not directly related to finding items in the database.",

You can scan or manually enter a barcode into the barcode box to search for an item. When selected, a default quantity of 1 is added. Step 4: Use Find Item Manually. You can search for an item manually using various options: Search Text: Find the item based on a whole word or use \" before or after the word to search for all possibilities (e.g., \"can\" for candles or \"*proof\" for waterproof). Vendor: Use the drop-down to select one or more vendors from the list. Item Groups: Use the drop-down to select one or more item groups from the list.

Step 5: When all counts are added, choose the Back button to close the count page. All counts are automatically saved. If you entered a description into the Physical section box, it will appear in the Count list. Use the drop-down to see all Counts.

    "text": "Tax Groups are a collection of tax rates that are applied to specific products or services. These tax rates are determined by factors such as the product category, country, region, or state where the transaction takes place. In a point-of-sale (POS) system, taxes are grouped to identify the tax owed on a sale of an item in a particular location. By assigning a tax group to a product or service, the system can quickly determine the appropriate tax rate to apply to the transaction. Tax Groups can be configured to support different tax scenarios, such as varying tax rates for different regions, or tax exemptions for certain products or services. Effective management of tax groups can help ensure accurate tax reporting, minimise errors, and streamline the sales process. Tax Codes are the individual taxes within a Group, such as Standard rate, Reduced rate, Zero rate etc. These can be timed to come in to effect if needed. Within the Taxes area you can make modifications to your existing Tax Groups and Codes, and you can create new Tax Groups and Codes to suit your business needs. Tax Groups Allows for the creation of new Tax Groups through the Add Tax Group button. The Search bar will allow you to search on the Tax Group Name or Number of Tax Codes to allow for easy identification of the existing Tax Group. Add Tax Group Click the Add Tax Group button to add a new group. Tax Group Name Identify the tax group by name, can be letters, numbers and special characters. Can be a maximum of 50 characters. This is the name you use to identify the Tax Group in other areas of Imagine. This name must be unique across your list of Tax Groups Tax Code Name Identify the tax code by name, can be letters, numbers and special characters. Can be a maximum of 50 characters. Additional tax codes can be added after the initial creation. See the \"modifying tax groups\" section below. . This is the name you use to identify the Tax Code in other areas of Imagine Percent A decimal number, up to two decimal places that is zero or greater. This Percent is the default percentage and is used to calculate tax liability, therefore must be accurate. Once created additional tax code percentage can be added along with \"valid from\" times After the initial creation you will be given the opportunity to add additional tax codes. When you are finished you should use the Back button to complete and save your changes. See the \"modifying tax groups\" section below. Overview Lists all your existing Tax Groups and the number of tax codes associated with that group.

Here you can edit the Tax Group Name as well as create new and edit existing tax rates. Note: when editing the Tax Group Name, remember this name must be unique across your list of Tax group Names. You must click the save icon for name changes to complete When you have completed editing your tax codes click the Back button to return to the overview screen To delete the entire Tax Group, use the Delete button, and then click on the orange banner to confirm the action.

The Tax Group Name must be unique. when compared to other Tax Group Names in your list Default Percentage Tax Code percentage, as a decimal number, up to two decimal places. This percentage you cannot remove individually and will be the 'default' value where another percentage is not valid. Tax Percentage The tax percentage. as a decimal number, up to two decimal places. Valid From A date from which this percentage comes in to use. This could be for a temporary tax change or to implement a tax change outside of office hours. The \"default\" percentage does not have this function. Any percentage that is valid by the given date will continue to be valid until it is superseded by a new value or deleted. The Valid From date is inclusive, that is it comes into force at 00:00:01 on the date selected Note: tax codes ensure, when a transaction is completed in a shop, that the correct tax percentage due for that item is recorded. In order to do this there are several other areas to consider when setting up taxes Each Shop must have a Tax Group assigned. Shops must know for each given item, whether they can apply to the item a corresponding Tax Code inline with the shops Tax Group (and thus what tax percentage they should apply to the transaction). Without this information a shop cannot sell the item. Knowing this can be via the Primary Group, the Group or the Tax Group assigned in Shop Configuration. It is possible to have tax groups assigned in all of these areas, so Imagine will check firstly in the Primary Group, then in the Groups (in order of the listed Groups), and finally in the Shop Configuration - Tax Group for the Tax Code to apply. It is not possible to create or edit a shop so that it does not have a Tax Group configured Each item can be assigned a Tax Code from each Tax Group. Each shop will then be able to list items for sale where the shops Tax Group matches the items Tax Code Item Hierarchies require a Tax Code per Tax Group in a similar fashion to Items. This allows for collecting the correct tax on Item Group sales",

    "text": "TABLE OF CONTENTS There are several examples of how Item Info can be used, such as: Examples of gathering information to gain insights about your customers or sales include: Item Info overview Adding Item Info Linking an Item Info to an Item The Item Info feature is used to include supplementary details about an item at the point of sale or to collect further information regarding the purchase of the item. There are several examples of how Item Info can be used, such as: Assisting the clerk in providing more detailed information about items to the customer. Reminding the clerk about up-selling or cross-selling opportunities. Providing advice to the customer about the item they are purchasing. Verifying the customer's age. Examples of gathering information to gain insights about your customers or sales include: The Item Info feature can also be used to: Request the customer's permission to receive promotional material via email from the business. Collect anonymous and non-intrusive demographic information about the customer base, such as gender, age range, and whether the customer is shopping alone or in a group. Furthermore, the data captured through Item Info can be associated with the transaction (either at the header or detail level) and stored for reporting purposes in the future. Item Info overview After clicking on Item Info you will be presented with a list of already created Item Info. Add Item Info Clicking on the \"Add Item Info\" button will lead the user to the screen where they can create new Item Info. Edit Button This enables editing of any previously created Item Info. Delete Button This allows deleting an Item Info. NOTE: Item Info should only be deleted when it is no longer in use. Active Check Box This feature enables the user to mark an Item Info as active or inactive by assigning a tick and then saving the changes. By default, newly created Item info is active. It is recommended not to delete an Item's Info until it has been marked as inactive. Prompt Every This is the point where the prompt will be displayed to the cashier. Adding Item Info Description Displays the description for any Item Info that has been created Info Type Displays the type of information for any created Item Info, which can be either Info or Question. Prompt Every Shows the selected prompt frequency for any created Item info on the POS, which can be Line or Transaction. Transaction: The message or question should only be presented once during a transaction when the same item is scanned. For example, if I purchase three identical items, I would prefer the clerk to suggest batteries only once, rather than repeating the suggestion three times. Line: The message or question should be displayed every time an item is scanned. This is necessary because we may need to collect information or send a message about each item line, such as in the case of a sale of a pair of shoes where we need to confirm a matching pair. Remember to click \"Save\" when finished or \"Back\" to cancel any changes. Display Text This is the prompt/message text which will be displayed on the POS Custom Item Attribute The drop-down menu allows selecting the Custom Item Attributes that will activate the Item Info prompt at the POS. Please note that only Yes/No type Custom Attributes will appear in the drop-down list as they are the ones that link the item to the Item Info. Question Choices This field will only be displayed when the Info Type is set to Question. Here, the user can enter the options that the clerk can choose from, such as \"Yes,\" \"No,\" or \"Maybe.\" Each choice should be saved by hitting Enter between them. All other required fields should be completed as needed. Linking an Item Info to an Item After creating and saving the Item Info, you must link it to an item. As previously mentioned, the Item Info must be linked to a Custom Attribute. The Custom Attributes Tab page provides instructions on how to link a Custom Attribute to an item. Once linked and the item is added to the transaction screen in the POS, the Item Info will be displayed.",

This gives you the configured discount options you have enabled previously in PoS Options. To remove an exact monetary amount from the line as an absolute value. Entering 10 will represent discounting by 10 pounds (this will change depending on what currency you have set up). This will apply a percentage discount to the line. For example, entering 10 here will reduce the line by 10%. When you press either of these buttons the soft keyboard will appear, enter the value of discount required. You can also have configurable Discount Hotkeys. These can quickly apply a 10% or 20% discount (see POS Discount Buttons for more details) to the line with no further entry required. If you have reason codes set up these will appear in the left-hand menu. Click the type of reason, this will then display in the line info. You can apply for discounts as many times as you like. The discount is applied to the current discounted price, but the discount % it displays will always be relative to the original item price So on a £100 item, if you press 10% discount, it will take the price to £90. Pressing the 10% discount again will take £9 off because 10% of 90 is 9. The price will then be £81. The discount displayed will be 19% rather than 20%. You can remove any applied Discount by pressing the bin icon on the discount section of the transaction line. If any Receipt/Transaction Discounts are applied these must be removed from the Subtotal bar.",

When you select either of these buttons, the soft keyboard will appear, allowing you to enter the desired discount value. Note: Although you enter a monetary value, this will convert it to a percentage before applying it across all lines in the discount. Because transaction discounts get converted to line discounts spread across the basket, this may mean rounding resulting in a few extra pence/cents discount being applied. You can also utilize configurable Discount Hotkeys. These enable you to quickly apply a predefined discount percentage, such as 10% or 20%, to the line without further input. The values for these hotkeys can be configured through K3 or the Back Office. Another method is setting a total transaction price. By clicking the \"Total\" box, you can enter a new total transaction value and click the confirmation button to apply the amount. If you have reason codes configured, they will appear in the Widgets Menu for selecting specific reasons associated with the discount. Note that Total Discounts are displayed and printed on the receipt to show the overall discount amount. However, in the data, the discount is allocated and stored at the Line level as if it were a Line discount. To remove or cancel a discount, click on the total amount to bring up the discount options.

Gift Certificate You will be asked to enter the Gift Certificate number. This will only accept Gift Certificates which have been generated by the POS. Credit Note You will be asked to enter the Credit Note number. This will only accept Credit Notes which have been generated by the POS. Other These will be labelled as \"Foreign\" or \"Manual\" but also include Bank, Webshop and Mobile Payment. They have no special functionality except that they don't register cash in a drawer.

    "text": "You can sell products that aren't set up in the system or don't require stock tracking using the \"Item Group\" button during transactions. This feature lets you sell an item without specifying its details, which is handy for low-value items you want to clear or those without barcodes. Item Group sales allow you to track and analyze sales at a higher level, rather than individual items. The available Item Groups at the point of sale (PoS) come from the Item Hierarchy structure. Each Item Group has a tax code for accurate tax collection. However, to see an Item Group at the PoS, the store must be linked to the same Tax Group Code as the Item Hierarchy, and the store must have the Item Hierarchy selected. The following explains the process in detail. To select where the Item Group should appear on the Point of Sale (POS), go to the Back Office and click on \"Shops\" from the options list. Choose the appropriate location and take note of the Primary Group and Tax Group information to ensure correct display on the POS. To view tax rates for a specific Item Hierarchy, go to \"Inventory\" in the menu and select \"Item Hierarchies\". Choose the desired Node and click on the edit icon to see the assigned tax rates and make adjustments if needed. If adjustments are necessary, refer to the \"Create Hierarchies Root Node\" section for guidance. Note: You can only select one tax code per tax group. To set up Item Hierarchies for your groups, navigate to \"Groups\" in the Back Office. Create a new group (and set it as the Primary Group for your shop) or edit an existing group. Ensure that the Item Hierarchy list on the Group Details page includes the desired hierarchy for display on the Point of Sale (PoS). Save any changes made. When launching your shop's PoS, the \"Item Groups\" button will show the groups set up in the previous step. Click on the \"Item Groups\" button from the menu to access it. The configured Item Groups can be viewed in the centre panel using this feature. To sell items under a specific Item Group, simply click on it and enter the desired selling price when prompted. If you have multiple Item Groups, use the filter buttons at the bottom to refine your list. Clicking on a filter button will display the filter, and you can further narrow down the list using the search box. Additionally, the \"Sort By\" option allows you to arrange your Item Groups by ID number or Name. The Reset button will clear any applied filters. The cancel button will return you to the Transaction screen.",

    "text": "NOTE: The Sell Set feature is intended to be deprecated after April 2023. You should consider using PPE Promotions instead. Sell Set allows you to sell a selection of items together for a fixed price. For example, you may sell a Shirt, a Tie and a pair of cufflinks and give them to the customer for €100. Press the Sell Set button on the menu to include items into a set. The transaction screen changes to show you this. Anything you scan or search for will be bundled together into the \"Set\" except for any items marked as “POS Block Discount” or Item Group. Neither of these types of items can be added to a Sell Set. Items will be added as individual lines and not aggregated. This is similar to the option POS Block Quantity Entry. It is possible to add a Prompt For Price item to a Sell Set but such items are given the price you enter. Any discount available from the Sell Set promotion is apportioned across the other items in the Sell Set. At least two or more items must be included in your set. When you have included everything you want in your set click the OK button or tap the Enter Amount box to key in the price you want to sell the set for. It will pop open the Soft Keyboard for you to enter a value. Press the Green Tick to apply the total price for the Set. A set must have a value greater than 0 (zero) to be valid. Once the price is entered it cannot be altered. To change the price of a set you should delete the set and start again Tap the Enter Amount box to key in the price you want to sell the set for. It will pop open the Soft Keyboard for you to enter a value. press the Green Tick to apply the price. NOTE: There are set denominations for quick use. The transaction then gets the discount split across the transaction lines and quantities. When an item is part of a set you cannot make changes to individual components of that set. Selecting one of the items will allow you to either Delete the whole set, set the item as a Gift or change the Clerk. NOTE: Pressing the Delete option on any set item will remove the entire set. To make changes to a set once the price has been applied will require you to delete the set and start again. You can continue adding additional items to the basket and make your payment when ready as per any other transaction.",

It allows for browser-based printing and can connect to a cash drawer. It is important to note that an Ethernet connection is required, and it must be connected to the network through a CAT5e cable or higher. The Connector is compatible with two types of printers: K3-manufactured printers and Epson T88V printers. Additionally, any Epson-compatible cash drawer connected to the same printers is also supported. PRINTERS The K3 Thermal Receipt Printer is a 40-column receipt printer, similar to an Epson T88, that is manufactured by K3. It requires a serial connection (9-pin) and features an onboard Drawer Kicker, which can be used to activate the connected cash drawer. The Epson T88V is another standard printer that requires a serial connection (25-pin) and also includes an onboard Drawer Kicker for the connected cash drawer. It's important to note that specific dip switch settings are necessary for the TM88V, which can be found in the installation instructions for the printer. The ODP333 is a 40-column receipt printer, similar to an Epson T88, that is manufactured by Aures. For this printer, baud settings may need to be adjusted and logos must be flashed to the printer memory. LABEL PRINTERS The Citizen CL-S521 is the sole label printer that is supported and uses thermal direct printing. It's important to note that while other label printers that support the ZPL language and feature a serial port may function properly, they are not directly supported by K3. CASH DRAW K3 Cash Drawer - This is manufactured by K3 using an Epson Compatible Drawer Kick port. Any Epson-compatible Cash Drawer. SCANNERS To ensure the proper functioning of any scanner used with the POS software, it must be able to support and run \"Keyboard Wedge\" via USB, PS/2, or Bluetooth. We recommend testing the scanner with any barcode labels in use, whether pre-printed on products or printed in-house, as well as scanning the receipt barcode to ensure that the output precisely matches the data represented by the barcode. To run a simple test, scan the barcode into a text editor such as Notepad or TextEdit and compare the data to the barcode. Please note that some options within Imagine enable simultaneous printing to both label and receipt printers, such as gift receipt/label printing. If only one printer is being used, the connector will attempt to print to the only available device if these options are selected, which may result in random characters appearing on either labels or receipts. If this occurs, please check the settings within Imagine and use only the available device. BARCODE SCANNER Imagine has been found to work seamlessly with both USB and Bluetooth scanners that are set to keyboard wedge mode. However, as there are numerous types of platforms, browsers, connection types, and driver requirements, K3 cannot provide an exhaustive list of the compatible scanner makes and models. NCR SCO TRI-LIGHT The NCR SCO tri-light requires the SCO Agent to be running to function. This can be installed by your local K3 representative or by contacting your local K3 Support.",

Be sure to remove the Power Cable from the Connector by pulling the sleeve back and not by forcing the cable as this may cause damage to the cable and pins. Connect the printer to the Connector using the supplied USB cable. Connect the cash drawer to the printer using the supplied DK cable. Connect the Connector to your network (router) using the supplied network cable. Note that your network must support DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) and allow the device to be assigned an IP address that has outgoing Internet access. Press the On button to power on the Connector. Wait a few moments for the Connector to connect to the Internet. A blue LED will indicate that the Connector is powered on. Check into the K3 servers and print a status report. This report will have the IP address and Unit ID you need to add via the K3 Connector Manager. Note that when adding a new Connector and configuring it to a store, it may take up to 10 minutes to complete. When it has finished, you will receive a startup notification printout. Note that if the Startup Complete slip prints without an IP address, you should check your network settings and router. A missing IP address means the Connector has not been issued an IP address automatically. Example of a Startup Slip Example of a Startup Complete Slip",

Note the COM port it connects to, which can be found in the device manager. Start up the PrinterTool.exe and configure the printer by setting the COM port to the one it's connected to and hit \"Configure the port.\" Set the baud rate to 38400 and then hit \"Set Printer.\" On the first tab, set the code page to \"CHINESE\" and set the baud rate to 38400. Hit \"Set\" and the printer should beep. On the \"BIG5\" tab, set the emulation mode to \"EPSON ESC/POS\" and language to \"Chinese GB 18030.\" Hit \"Set\" on both options. On the first tab again, hit \"Self-Test.\" The printer should print out its configuration, and the code page at the top should now read \"GBK\" along with some Chinese characters. Unplug the printer and plug it back into your connector, then reboot your connector. SSH onto the connector and change the docker-compose.yml file by adding the following configuration to the arm gateway container as an environment variable: \"EncodingCodePageValue: 54936\" Reboot your connector again.",

    "title": "Connector Issues",
    "text": "Please note that the following list is non exhaustive, and if you are still experiencing difficulties connecting, please do not hesitate to contact the relevant local support team within K3 @Support - K3 (k3btg.com). Here are some troubleshooting steps: Check the power, USB, and Ethernet connections. Make sure the correct connector is selected via the POS using the USB icon. A green bar indicates the selected connector is working as expected. A red flashing bar indicates there is a problem with the selected connector. A green dot indicates the connector is available but not selected. A red dot indicates there is an issue with the connector. Ensure everything is connected correctly. See @Installing Hardware for more information. Make sure only the supplied hardware is plugged into the connector. Note that the Wi-Fi connector on the rear of the unit should not be relied on for connectivity. We advise a hardwired connection. If the connector is being used with just a label printer alone, the label printer must still be plugged into the lower USB port. Check that the connector is plugged in, the power cable and brick are assembled correctly, and the socket is switched on. Ensure the Ethernet cable is plugged into a live socket, router, or otherwise attached to LAN. If a live Ethernet connection is not available when the connector boots, it will wait 5 minutes before defaulting to the previously cached IP, and it will continue to boot. If your connector prints the start-up slip, but you still cannot connect and the boot time has been longer than normal, we recommend you connect a screen to the connector to check it's not waiting for an IP address to be issued by DHCP. Ensure the Ethernet connection is working by using another compatible device. Make sure the receipt printer is powered on and connected via the USB/Serial Converter before booting the connector. Note that if any cables are removed while the connector is powered on, then the connector must be rebooted. Check if there is sufficient paper in the receipt printer and if the lid is closed correctly. Ensure the printer is powered on and connected via the serial cable and USB/Serial Converter. Check if the start-up slip has been printed. If it's blank, check that the paper is correctly installed into the printer. If using an Epson TM88 printer, after 90 seconds of booting up, if the start-up slip has not been printed, check the DIP switches. If the start-up slip has printed, check for the IP address. If there is no IP shown, please check your router and network setup. Check if the connector is listed in Platform Admin. You should be able to see a local IP address and a 'last seen' date. If the connector is listed but there is no IP, contact K3. If the POS is showing the connector as offline (red flashing dot), this is often a sign the certificate is not installed correctly. Please check in the Certificate Manager for your operating system for the certificate, and if necessary, re-install. Ensure the connector is set up in Admin. The ID must match the unit ID on the printed slip. Note that the hex code should be exactly 6 sets of numbers and letters and be separated by - not : as displayed on the start-up slip.",

    "title": "Installing an Epson TM88V",
    "text": "NOTE: The full TM88v manual can be found at https://files.support.epson.com/pdf/pos/bulk/tm-t88v_hwum_en_02.pdf Cable Selection To successfully connect to an Epson TM88v printer, you will need a 9-pin female to 25-pin male serial cable. The choice of cable is critical to ensure that the printer operates correctly. If you encounter printing issues despite having the correct setup, you may need to consider swapping the cable for a different brand or make. Additionally, since the connector only offers USB ports, you will need a Serial to USB converter to establish the connection. If you require further guidance, please consult your K3 Consultant for advice. Baud Speed - Hardware Setting You will require a crosshead screwdriver to physically adjust the DIP switches. Before proceeding, ensure that the TM88v is switched off and unplugged from the main power supply. Next, locate the metal cover on the underside of the TM88v. To configure the switches, set switches 7 and 8 to the on position on DSW1, but leave the other switches across both banks unchanged. After adjusting the switches, replace the metal cover, turn the TM88v over, and reconnect the power supply. Finally, power on the TM88v. To set the baud rate of the TM88v to 38400, you will need to adjust the hardware DIP switches as described in the previous instructions. Even if the self-test/Firmware Version printout indicates that the baud speed is already set to 38400, it is recommended to follow the steps below, as the values displayed in the printout can be inaccurate. To begin, power off the TM88v and then press and hold the Feed button while powering it on. Release the Feed button once the Firmware Version page has been printed, which will display both the Baud Rate and DIP Switch settings. These values need to be verified using the remaining steps outlined below. Press the Feed button for one second or more to print the Mode Selection page. Next, quickly press the Feed button three times, then press and hold the Feed button to display the Customize Value Settings page. Press the Feed button three times quickly, then press and hold the Feed button again to show the Baud Rate page. Verify that the default and current set values match the port settings, which should be 38400bps. To change the Current Set Value, press the Feed button quickly five times (38400bps), then press and hold the Feed button for more than one second. The new baud rate will be displayed as \"Saved.\" Finally, turn off the TM88v and turn it back on without pressing or holding the Feed button. Below is an excerpt of the Serial Interface settings for the DIP switches. Highlighted are the relevant parts for setting the Baud speed to 38400.",

    "text": "TABLE OF CONTENTS Item Data Filters Key Performance Figures Data Performance Table The Dashboard has been broken down into 3 sections to explain what each area is used for. Item Data Filters NOTE: If a field is left blank this will automatically choose all options available. NOTE: The search will only return up to the number of lines of data as configured in Analysis Configuration. If your search exceeds the limit a notification will display. Shops Choose from your set list of shops. Vendor Select specific or all vendors available. Shop Group Choose a group of selected shops. Company This can be used if a Tenant has multiple companies within Imagine. Hierarchy This is to narrow down a category as required by only one level. NOTE: You can narrow down Hierarchy Levels further by using the Column Chooser. Dimensions Here you can input particular Dimensions of a product that were given at Item Creation. Master Item Name This is the Name given to the Item at creation. Item Description This can be used to narrow down descriptive information about a product such as Material type, weight, size, artist information, design notes etc. Item Barcode This is used as the item identifier when purchased or scanned. Vendor Item Number The Vendor number or code by which the master item is known or referenced. Master Item Number This is the number or code by which the master item is known or referenced. Item Number This is the number or code by which the master item is known or referenced. Item Status Select between if an item is Active or Inactive. Group by Columns Used to group data into summary rows based on the number of columns you pick. For example if you pick 1,2 then, after you press Submit, the data will be grouped by the left most column and then by the second left column and you will see one row for each combination. This can be beneficial where you are planning on viewing large data sets and wish to see summary information initially. To see detailed grouping you should use the 'Drag column header' feature explained in Grouping Categories. NOTE: When pressing Submit you may receive a warning about invalid group column, you should adjust the left most columns to valid entries. Saves Reports, this will also save the format you have configured. Resets the filters to default values This will fetch the data if available. To review past saved reports. See My Analysis for more details. Key Performance Figures These are static boxes of overall information from the data shown in the Item Performance Table. Qty On-hand The current quantity of items in-store that are available to sell. This includes Reserved stock but excludes Offline. Where more than one shop is selected the value here is the sum of all selected shop's Qty On-hand. Val On-hand The quantity On-hand for a shop multiplied by the weighted average tenant cost. Where more than one shop is selected then Val On-hand is calculated for each individual selected shop and summed together. Note: the Val On-hand is the weighted average tenant cost rather than the weighted average shop cost as shown in the Figures Tab. Qty On-Order The number of items on Placed PO's, meaning those items outstanding not on a Completed Goods Receive. Where more than one shop is selected the value here is the sum of each selected shop's Qty On-Order. Val On-Order The monetary value amount of items on order calculated as the current weighted average tenant cost multiplied by the current quantity on order. Where more than one shop is selected then Val On-Order is calculated for each selected shop and summed together. Qty In-Transit The number of units in transit between shops, awaiting completion of the transfer. Specifically, the quantity of items that have been transferred out from the selected shop but have not been received at the 'transfer in' shop. Once the receiving shop has transferred this item(s) in then the stock is no longer deemed as 'In Transit'. Where more than one shop is selected then the value here is the sum of each selected shops Qty In-Transit. Val In-Transit The monetary value amount of items that have been transferred out of your shop calculated as the current weighted average tenant cost multiplied by the current quantity in transit. Where more than one shop is selected the Val In-Transit is calculated for each selected shop and summed together. Qty Off-Line The number of units held as offline stock for the shop, that is items you have in-store but are not available to sell for a particular reason i.e. damaged or unaccounted for. Where more than one shop is selected the value here is the sum of all selected shop's Qty Off-Line. Val Off-Line The monetary value amount for items marked as offline calculated as the current weighted average tenant cost multiplied by the current quantity offline. Where more than one shop is selected then Val Off-Line is calculated for each selected shop and then summed together. Item Data Performance Table The table shows the data of which information you have selected from the fields above, you can modify the way the information is displayed. Search Use the Search Bar to find data in the table below Export All Data This will export the data to a .xlxs file for use. There is no option to print directly from this page. Column Chooser This will bring up a list of options to add or remove columns. Reset Grid Filters Resets any filters applied to the Data table",

    "title": "Grouping Catagories",
    "text": "To group data in the Item Data Performance Table, follow these steps: Click and hold the header you want to group by (e.g., \"Shop\"), and drag it into place. If you want to remove a column header from the grouping, perform the reverse action by dragging it from its position and dropping it back into the table where you want the header to be placed. Notes The table will automatically update as you add, remove and alter positions of the headers. Headers placed furthest to the left will automatically be the major grouping, whilst headers further to the right will be subsequently more minor groupings. The example below explains this in more detail. Columns that display variable digital denominations, large blocks of text and other limitations cannot be grouped. You will not be able to drop these headers in the 'drag and drop' area. In Items, examples of the headers that cannot be grouped are: Qty On-hand Value On-Hand Qty On-Order Sales Price Example of grouping with a single column: Once you group the data, the Item Data Performance Table will display the information in a different format, showing the groups. In this case, it will be grouped by \"Shops.\" You can use the arrow next to each shop's name to expand and view more detailed information. Example of grouping with multiple columns: If you choose multiple headers to group by, you will have a stack of groups. For example, you may have \"Shops\" as the major header, and within each shop, you can further group by \"Date\". To change the hierarchy of the data, arrange the groups in the desired order. The data will stack based on the order of the groups you arrange with major priority to the left, moving to minor priority as you move to the right.",

    "title": "Check Customer Points via POS",
    "text": "You can verify a customer's total loyalty points and their corresponding monetary value using either the Customer module or the POS (Point of Sale) system. To check loyalty points via the POS, make sure the 'Customer' widget is enabled. For detailed instructions on enabling widgets, please refer to the documentation on Widgets. Once the widget is enabled, you will find the customer widget conveniently located on the left-hand side of the POS screen when you log in as a user. This widget provides you with the necessary functionality to search for customers and access their loyalty points information. Click ‘Search Customer’ to view the customer list to select from. Use the filter option to break down the search if required. When a customer has been selected, the customer details will be displayed in the customer widget on the left-hand side of the POS screen. Loyalty Points and their monetary values are separated into. Available – Points that have completed the quarantine period are now available for redemption. You can use these points to offset the cost of future purchases. Not yet available – Points accrued within the quarantine period are not yet available for redemption. These points can only be redeemed once the specified number of quarantine days, as defined in the scheme rules, have passed since the date the points were accrued. Accruing Points To enable customers to earn points during their shopping experience, you can easily add them to the transaction using the widget before finalizing the sale. The transaction should be partially paid with currency or, if allowed by the loyalty scheme's rules, with gift certificates. The points earned will be calculated based on the amount paid with currency or gift certificates, adhering to the scheme rules. When it comes to redeeming loyalty points for a purchase, the customer must have a sufficient \"Available points\" total that meets or exceeds the specified \"Minimum available points before spending\" requirement as outlined in the scheme rules. To proceed with the redemption, you can include the customer in the sale utilizing the \"Customer\" widget. If the available points fall below the minimum requirement for spending, the POS system will display a relevant message indicating the need for more points. Add items that the customer wishes to purchase. When the sale is ready to be paid for, select ‘Payment’ at the bottom of the POS screen. From the payment options on the right-hand menu, select Loyalty Bonus. Additional Notes If the value of the available loyalty points is insufficient to cover the total value of the sale, an additional payment method will be necessary. This means that the customer will need to provide an alternative form of payment to cover the remaining amount not covered by the loyalty points. In transactions where loyalty points have been redeemed, customers will still accrue loyalty points. However, points will only be accrued for the portion of the transaction value that is paid with currency or, if permitted by the loyalty scheme, with gift certificates. The redeemed portion of the transaction value will not earn additional loyalty points. When loyalty points are redeemed, they will be deducted from the customer's \"Available points\" total. This ensures that the customer's remaining balance accurately reflects the redeemed points.",

    "text": "Step 1: Find the stocktake you want to add a count to and open it by clicking on it. Make sure it is the correct partial stocktake by checking the selection filters shown on the screen. Step 2: Select \"Count\". Step 3: This opens a counting page where you can manually add items or choose to import a count from a file. For importing a file, refer to the separate section on File Import. Step 4: Enter the Physical Section you are currently counting. You can choose to add your counts in individual sections, which may reflect the way you break down the count with the shop. If you are importing, the sections may be determined by the import file. These individual count lists can be selected later and amended before completing the stocktake. Step 5: If you leave the Physical Section box blank, all counts will show under the header of \"Default\" in the Count drop-down list. Step 6: Enter the Barcode by scanning or manually typing it into the barcode box. When selected, a default quantity of 1 is added. Step 7: Alternatively, you can \"Find Item Manually\" by searching using text, vendor, or item groups. When selected, a default quantity of 1 is added. The \"Total Number of Unique Barcodes\" represents the number of entries in the stocktake. The \"Total Counted Quantities\" represents the total number of counted quantities. When \"Negate Quantity\" is set as \"Yes,\" adding an item via the Enter Barcode option will deduct the quantity from the count. Step 8: If \"Add Items Not Currently in Stocktake\" is set as \"No,\" only items in the selected filter can be added. If set as \"Yes,\" items outside the selected filter can also be added to the stock list and counted. Find Item Manually: \"Search Text\" allows you to find an item based on a whole word or use an asterisk () before or after the word to search for all possibilities. For example, \"can\" for candles or \"*proof\" for waterproof. Use the drop-down \"Vendor\" list to select one or more vendors from the available options. Use the drop-down \"Item Groups\" list to select one or more item groups from the available options. Clicking \"Search\" starts the search process and displays all the results in the list below.

Quantities are increased by 1 after each scan, and the Last Scanned item box shows the most recently scanned item. Step 3: You can manually adjust the quantity here rather than in the Manual Count list before moving to the next item. Step 4: If adding directly from the item list, count quantities can be adjusted using the Plus and Minus buttons or directly by choosing the quantity field. The quantity is limited to a maximum value of 10 digits (e.g., 9999999999) and up to a maximum of 2 decimals (e.g., 99999999.99). The minimum value is 0. Step 5: Use the items by page [5 10 20 50] and the page number [7 of 11 (54 items)] to scroll through and find more items. Step 6: When all counts are added, choose the Back button to close the count page. All counts are automatically saved. Step 7: If you entered a description into the Physical section box, it would appear in the Count list. Step 8: Use the drop-down to see all counts. Count - Location 55X: This indicates a specific count for Location 55X. Step 9: You can add more individual counts by choosing Count again from the top right-hand side (Step 3) and adding a different physical description. Step 10: To amend a specific location, e.g., Location 55X, choose Count again from the top right-hand side (Step 3) and type in the same description again. It MUST be the same; otherwise, it will show under a new count location.",

    "text": "Start Screen To initiate a transaction and access the main screen, the user has two options: they can either touch the screen directly or start scanning their items. To change the language, the user can simply touch the Flag icon located at the bottom centre of the screen. This action will reveal a list of optional languages. By touching the desired language, the user can make their selection. It's important to note that the start screen will always revert to the default language once the transaction is completed. To optimize efficiency, the screen automatically returns to the start screen if it remains inactive for a specified period. The duration of this idle timeout is determined by the Idle Timeout Settings in the Configuration. Idle Timeout If no action is taken within a specified timeframe, the SCO application will issue a warning indicating that the basket will be emptied and the user will be redirected to the start screen in another x seconds. It's important to keep in mind that while using the SCO, an \"idle\" timer constantly operates in the background, monitoring the user's activity and ensuring the system remains responsive. Main Screen The main screen of the SCO serves as the primary interface for user input before making a payment. It accommodates various input methods, including keyboard input such as a Keyboard Wedge Scanner. Upon scanning an item or manually searching for an item, the touch function is temporarily disabled until the item is successfully added to the transaction. This prevents any accidental inputs or disruptions during the process. To provide visual feedback and indicate the ongoing addition of an item to the transaction, a loading symbol will be displayed in the \"My Items\" section on the screen. This assures the user that the system is actively processing the request. Language Details Pressing the flag icon will give you a range of other languages to select from. Help! Pressing this will activate help mode if configured. It will notify the SCO Companion and also activate the TRI-Light for attention. My Items Details This area displays the item image, name and description as the items are scanned. My Items This section displays the list of items you have scanned and need to pay for. The example above illustrates a \"non-flattened\" list, which can be customized. Alternatively, you can choose a flattened list format, where each item is displayed in a single row without showing the quantity. Look Up Items This will show you the tiles which are configured as the Landing Group in the Visual Composer. See separate section. Press To Pay This button will advance you to the next stages of the process",

    "text": "TABLE OF CONTENTS Supervisor Interventions Item not Found Restricted Item Help Supervisor functions are essential for proceeding at this stage as without introducing it and explaining what it does, you will be unable to complete a transaction. To access Supervisor functions, simply scan any barcode which has been printed which begins with the same Clerk prefix which you have previously set up in Configuration. This will take you into the Supervisor functions screen. You can generate such barcodes with any common barcode generator and print them on whichever printer you like. For example, https://www.barcodesinc.com/generator/index.php Return Will return you back to the Main Screen with no further action Enter Full screen Puts the SCO in Full screen Mode (Does not work if the SCO is in Chrome's Kiosk mode as the browser overrides the behaviour) Exit Full screen Takes the SCO out of Full screen Mode (Does not work if the SCO is in Chrome's Kiosk mode as the browser overrides the behaviour) Print Last Receipt Will reprint the last receipt sent to the connector, in case there was a failure. Payment Device Allows you to choose the connector the SCO is using. These get configured in Admin. Disable Payments If this is deselected, then it will simulate payments and approve all transactions. This is not to be used in Live mode. Basket Here, you can alter the quantities for each line. Use the + and - buttons to adjust the quantity as needed. Useful if the shopper has scanned too many of an item and wants to reduce the quantity, or the item has been accidentally scanned and needs to be removed from the transaction. To remove an item reduce its quantity to 0 (zero) and the item will automatically be removed from the basket. Cancel Transaction This will void the transaction and return the SCO to the start screen. Supervisor Interventions There are some other scenarios where the supervisor will be required to scan their supervisor barcode. In these scenarios, if configured, the SCO Companion and/or Tri Light will be alerted also that action is required to be taken. Item not Found In the event a barcode is scanned but not recognised, it blocks the transaction proceeding. This is in order to not allow the customer to put it in their bag without realizing, and also so a colleague can note and identify why it would not scan. Restricted Item When a shopper tries to buy Age Restricted or Qty Restricted items then the TriLight (if configured) will turn orange indicating that attention will be required. Also at this point the SCO Companion will also turn Orange for the SCO and allow them to remotely approve. This allows the shopper to keep shopping and only be approved once at the end of the transaction. NOTE: Age Restricted or Quantity restricted items and are configured in Product Configure. Scan the supervisor barcode and then you will be asked to Approve Help Pressing the Help! button will alert the clerk and then the TriLight (if configured) will turn orange indicating that attention will be required.",

Before finalizing the payment, the system may prompt you (if configured) to indicate the number of bags you have used or purchased during the transaction. This allows for the inclusion of the bag count in the overall transaction. Unless payment functionality has been disabled for demonstration purposes, the SCO application will initiate the Connector to communicate with the Pin Entry Device (PED) and proceed with the payment. At this stage, the SCO relinquishes control and awaits further input. During this processing period, you will observe the following screen indicating the ongoing payment transaction. During this screen, the idle timeout feature is overridden and instead relies on the configurable timeout set specifically for the Pin Entry Device (PED). This timeout duration may vary depending on the payment provider and their respective settings. Upon successful payment, it indicates that the transaction has been completed, and the necessary information has been submitted to Imagine's backend for further processing. If you have configured receipt printing as an optional feature, you will be prompted to choose whether you want to print a receipt or not.

    "text": "This application is specifically designed to facilitate customer service using a Headless POS system. In addition to supporting cash and card payments, the Headless POS also includes functionalities for discounts and refunds. Here are some key points to note: - The Headless POS utilizes the Currency and Language settings configured in the Backoffice. These settings determine the default locale of the Headless POS, including formatting conventions for numbers and currencies (such as decimal or comma separators, and whether the currency symbol appears before or after the value). - The application will display the logo associated with the shop, which is obtained from the Backoffice's Shop Logo setting. - For live implementations, the use of a Pin Entry Device is required to process card payments. This necessitates having a K3 Connector, a compatible printer, a supported Payment Terminal, and a Payment Service Provider. However, for demonstration and testing purposes without a Connector, a Virtual payment option is available. - It's important to note that this application is designed to run on dedicated kiosk hardware without keyboard input. To prevent unintended actions, it is recommended to utilize Google Chrome's Kiosk mode, which helps prevent users from holding down the touch screen for extended periods and simulating a right-click action.",

    "text": "To group data in the Sales Data Performance Table, follow these steps: Click and hold the header you want to group by (e.g., \"Shop\"), and drag it into place. If you want to remove a column header from the grouping, perform the reverse action by dragging it from its position and dropping it back into the table where you want the header to be placed. Notes The table will automatically update as you add, remove and alter positions of the headers. Headers placed furthest to the left will automatically be the major grouping, whilst headers further to the right will be subsequently more minor groupings. The example below explains this in more detail. Columns that display variable digital denominations, large blocks of text and other limitations cannot be grouped. You will not be able to drop these headers in the 'drag and drop' area. In Sales examples of the headers that cannot be grouped are: Cost Sales Qty Tax Profit Example of grouping with a single column: Once you group the data, the Data Performance Table will display the information in a different format, showing the groups. In this case, it will be grouped by \"Shops.\" You can use the arrow next to each shop's name to expand and view more detailed information. Example of grouping with multiple columns: If you choose multiple headers to group by, you will have a stack of groups. For example, you may have \"Shops\" as the major header, and within each shop, you can further group by \"Date\". To change the hierarchy of the data, arrange the groups in the desired order. The data will stack based on the order of the groups you arrange with major priority to the left, moving to minor priority as you move to the right.",

If you require a different currency then another vendor should be created with the required currency set. Then you can select the items to incorporate into the order, you can auto-populate, bulk import or find them manually. Auto Populate - This feature automatically compares the quantity of stock currently available and the quantity already allocated to other purchase orders (but not yet received), with the predefined Restock Level. Based on this analysis, it generates a suggested quantity for replenishment. The concepts of Reorder Point and Restock Levels are explained in the Matrix. NOTE: Currently, Imagine maintains Reorder and Restock levels at the item level only, without considering specific levels for individual stores. Therefore, it is assumed that the same Reorder and Restock levels apply to all locations. However, provisions should be made for scenarios where Reorder and Restock levels are defined at the Item/Store level. Export Bulk Template - On the Export Bulk Template option, a spreadsheet is exported, named PurchaseOrder_ImportTemplate by default. The Item, Barcode, Name, Variant and Vendor Item No columns on this spreadsheet are read-only. You can alter the Vendor Cost Price and Quantity fields ready for import to the PO. NOTE: Although it is possible to export more than 5000 lines to Excel, if you intend to re-import the same spreadsheet you must make steps to ensure your import file is 5000 lines or less and file size is below 200Kb. If you do not meet these requirements you will receive the below warning. Import Bulk Template - Bulk Import Template and Export Bulk Template allows you to browse and import an excel spreadsheet. Or you can Find the Items Manually, you have a search facility, and it will limit the items to only those from the selected vendor. You also have the option to limit to specific item groups. NOTE: If expected items do not show or are greyed out on the PO check the items 'Do not place on Purchase Order' setting in Standard Attribute on the Matrix tab for Item Details. This option may be controlled by your Head Office. Save - This will save the PO in its current state. The PO has not been placed yet and cannot be linked to a Goods Receive. Place - This tells Imagine the order has been placed with the vendor and no further changes will be made to it. Placed POs can be linked to Goods Receive Notes.",

Test mode offers the following options: Enable Test Mode ticked, but no other options ticked The user’s interactions are directed to the HMRC test API. There are limited options available regarding filing periods etc, but this is a real-time call to the actual HMRC test service. This can be used to test connectivity to the HMRC services and confirm authentication. The filing periods provided by the HMRC test API are 3 periods in 2017, which may not be sufficient for testing. Therefore, you have the following additional options. Enable Test Mode ticked, Use Dummy Data ticked The Digital VAT app enables you to use a simulated user experience in testing and training. HMRC authentication is used, but the service does not call the HMRC test or production API’s. This provides the following dummy data, which you can use to simulate the full user experience without the risk of making an accidental submission to HMRC. This also allows for more periods than are available from the HMRC test API: Dummy submission periods, by quarter or month based on the Use Monthly Periods flag. Dummy Liabilities and Payments data. This shows what the screen will look like once populated with data from your live account and enables you to test the filters. Dummy submission IDs returned when clicking Submit. This simulates the actions of the HMRC API, but never actually contacts it. Enable Test Mode ticked, Use Dummy Data ticked, Use Monthly Periods ticked. Toggles the dummy submission period data between quarters (unticked) and months (ticked). K3 recommends, for initial testing Use Test Mode: Ticked Use Dummy Data: Ticked Use Monthly Periods: User option, based on their usual submission period setup.",

This article assumes a Stripe account has already been set up as is out of scope of K3 services. Note, there is a minimum transaction amount of 30pence with Stripe, so it is important to note this when testing the setup. Stripe Details In order to configure TOP, we need to key pieces of information from within the Stripe dashboard of the retailer. Secret Key Webhook Secret (Which requires a webhook to be setup) Secret Key Once logged in, Click the Developers button in the topbar of the dashboard. Click the API Keys tab, and then reveal secret key. It is this secret key we need as part of the setup. Webhook Secret In order to obtain a webhook secret, you need to create a webhook. The Webhook receives notifications back from Stripe to indicate that transactions are successful. Click the Webhooks tab, still within the Developers section and Add an Endpoint Enter the endpoint URL first. For production setups this is https://portal.k3imagine.com/ms-stripe/api/v1.0/Webhook. Then press Select Events wich allows us to choose what events they will send to our webhook. Scroll down and expand the Checkout section and enable checkout.session.complete. Click Add Events and then Add Endpoint and you'll see the webhook details. Reveal the signing secret and make a note of it, as we need that for the TOP setup. The Stripe setup is now complete.

As Stripe is our preferred payment provider for TOP, we have extended our integration to allow you to refund transactions from within Imagine. In Self Serve Admin > Shops Choose your Shop from the list, and there is a new tab for Stripe Refunds This shows you a filterable list of transactions that have been processsed through Stripe. It also shows you the Stripe Payment intent ID so you can cross reference the payment to the Stripe Dashboard. You will see there are 2 columns. Transaction Amount (The amount the original transaction was for) and Refunded Amount which is how much for that transaction has been refunded. This is a good visual indicator of any refunds you have had to process. When you have identified the transaction to refund, press the Arrow for it. You will see an itemised list of refunds applied to that transaction if any exist. Otherwise, enter the amount you want to refund into the box and press Refund. At this point the refund will be charged back to the customer on the card they originally paid with, and they will be emailed with a receipt from Imagine advising them of the refund. You'll get a toaster notification to advise its been successful. Reviewing the transaction with the refund applied will show the successful refund.",

    "text": "TABLE OF CONTENTS Creating a New Composer Group Adding Tiles to a Composer Group Time Restricted Tiles Amending Tiles Composer Groups are a collection of tiles that are presented to the user as a selection of options in front-end applications. Each application requires a \"Landing Group,\" which serves as the starting point for users to engage with the application. The selection of the landing group is configurable on a per-application and per-location basis in the Profile Overview section of the Backoffice. Creating a New Composer Group The Composer Group List displays all existing groups. To edit a group, simply click on the relevant group. To create a new Composer Group, click the \"Create New\" button. You will be taken to the below page. Display Name Refers to the name that will be visible to customers on the Self Serve Applications. It is the name that identifies the Composer Group and its content. Name It's important to use a unique name for the Composer Group as you cannot use the same name multiple times. If you try to use a name that already exists, you will receive a warning message. Image URL This is the image that will appear on the tile. The supported image types are .bmp, .gif, .jpeg, and .svg. Image Fill Setting This setting determines how the image will be displayed within the tile: Centred: The image will be positioned in the middle of the tile. Fill: The image will be resized to fill the entire tile, potentially cropping parts of the original image. After making any changes or updates to the Composer Group, click on the \"Save Composer Group\" button to save the changes. Once saved, a notification will appear in the top right corner to confirm that the changes have been saved. Adding Tiles to a Composer Group To add a Tile to a composer group, follow these steps: Click on the Composer Group you want to add a Tile to. Select the \"Add Tile\" button. A window will appear with options for which type of Tile you require. Choose the type of Tile you want to add. You will then be asked to search for and select an instance of the type you have chosen. Once you have selected the Tile instance, you can configure the settings for the Tile. Click \"Save\" to save the Tile to the Composer Group. A notification in the top right corner will appear to confirm that the Tile has been added to the Composer Group. Choosing a Tile Type Item This is a single Tile without grouping or stacking. Composer Group This is a Tile in which tiles will have a group or stack. Bundle A Composite Tile allows for multiple items to be displayed in a single Tile, such as a meal deal that includes both a drink and a meal. Advert This will create an Advert Tile. Advert Tiles are typically used in apps that run on the consumer's devices, but may not be suitable for kiosks or self-checkout systems. Options for Creating a New Entity and Relevant Pages Create a new Item This will take you to the Item Creation page. Create a new Bundle This will take you to the Product Configurator> Bundles page. Create a new Composer Group This will take you to a blank new Composer Group Page. Time Restricted Tiles You can set times for when you require a tile to appear or disappear. This is helpful for certain periods of the day, for example, having different meal types for Breakfast or Lunchtimes. You can also have promotional tiles linked to different items/bundles with special prices if required. Times are set in 30-minute increments and are not a specific reference to a time of day relevant for time zones. For example, if you set the time for \"3 pm\" then the tiles will display relative to the time of that location I.E Happy Hour in London and New York can both be 3 pm-4 pm, relative to when those cities reach that time. Amending Tiles When you hover your mouse over a tile, the edit symbol will appear. Click this to begin editing the tile. To delete a tile, use the delete button located in the top left corner. If the tile is part of a Composer Group, you will see a \"Go to Group\" button. Clicking this will take you to the selected group for editing. To save any changes made to the Composer Group, click on the \"Save Composer Group\" button. Note that this button is disabled until changes are made on the selected group. If you wish to delete a Composer Group, click on the \"Delete\" button. A prompt will appear to confirm the deletion. Selecting \"Yes\" will permanently delete the Composer Group, while selecting \"No\" will cancel the action. The Tiles are displayed in a grid format that can be rearranged by dragging and dropping them into place. The order of the Tiles is always from left to right, assuming one long wrapped row. This is because each device has different dimensions, and the Tiles need to be responsive to fit all screen sizes. Active Tiles are displayed with a white background, while inactive Tiles are displayed with a grey background. Inactive Tiles are not displayed to customers.",

Please note that when using Kiosk mode in Chrome, the full screen function may not work as it is overridden by the browser's settings. Choose Arm Device: The term \"Arm\" refers to the Connector. In this function, you can select from a list of Connectors that you have set up in the Admin settings. If you don't have a physical Arm device, you can use the Virtual Connector as an alternative. However, please be aware that the Virtual Connector should not be used in a live environment, as it bypasses payment processing and assumes a full payment has been made. Refresh Kiosk: Selecting this option will clear the current basket, return you to the start screen, and reload all the Composer tiles. It allows you to start fresh and begin a new transaction.

    "title": "Items / Bundles / Modifiers",
    "text": "When you add a Bundle or Modifiable item to your basket in the Kiosk, you will be prompted to make the necessary selections or modifications before adding them to the basket. This ensures that you can customize your order according to your preferences. If the Bundle main item has Modifiers linked to it, the Kiosk will automatically direct you to the Modifiers tab, providing you with the option to make any desired alterations to the modifiers associated with the item. This allows you to tailor the item to your specific requirements before finalizing your order. For non-bundled items with Modifiers in the Kiosk, only the Modifiers will be shown to you. You won't see any other bundled items in this case. Next to the Modifier title, you will find the min-max rule for the selections, which indicates the allowed range or limits for choosing the modifiers. Additionally, any additional prices associated with the modifiers will be displayed. It's important to note that any modifications you make to the item, including the chosen modifiers, will be printed on the order confirmation slip. Furthermore, these modifications will be reflected in the Order Status Display, which is used in the order preparation area. This ensures that your customizations are accurately communicated for the preparation of your order. Modifications made during the ordering process are seamlessly incorporated into the system. These modifications are effectively recorded and conveyed through two channels: Order Confirmation Slip: The order confirmation slip, generated upon completion of the order, includes a comprehensive summary of all the modifications made. This ensures that the printed confirmation slip provides a clear and detailed record of the customized order. Order Status Display: The modifications are also transmitted to the Order Status Display, which serves as a visual reference for the order preparation area. The Order Status Display prominently presents the modifications, ensuring that the staff can easily access and implement them during the order preparation process. By integrating modifications into both the order confirmation slip and the Order Status Display, the system facilitates accurate and efficient communication of customizations, streamlining the overall order fulfillment workflow. Basket The Basket screen shows a list of your items, along with any bundle selections and modifiers you have made. They are grouped together, so if you have made more than one item with the same selections and modifiers they will be on the same basket line. It clearly denotes the extended price of the basket line and also displays the quantity multiplied by the single item price. Icon Name Function Edit Line You can use the pencil icon for the basket line to make alterations to that line (change modifiers or bundle selections). Delete Line Use the trash can icon to remove the line from the basket. Delete Basket Use the black trash can next to the Pay button to clear the basket and return to the start screen. Pay Button Use the Continue button to proceed to the payment phase.",

This timer is designed to monitor user activity and engagement. If no action is taken within the defined timeframe, the Kiosk will issue a warning indicating that the basket will be emptied and you will be returned to the start screen after a specific number of seconds. This feature serves as a reminder to keep the session active and prevents prolonged periods of inactivity, ensuring an efficient and responsive user experience. Providing a warning before emptying the basket and returning to the start screen, allows users to take appropriate action or continue their interaction with the Kiosk to avoid unintended disruptions. This idle timeout is configurable. Payment Pressing the Pay button will, unless you are using the Virtual connector for testing and demo purposes, initiate the Connector to instruct the Pin Entry Device to make a payment. At this point, the Kiosk has handed over control and is awaiting further input. You will see the below screen whilst it is processing. On this screen, the idle timeout is ignored and instead uses whatever configurable timeout is used for that PED, and that will vary between payment providers. If the payment fails, you will be advised and after 5 seconds it will return you to the basket to try another card. You should refer to the PED for details on why the transaction was declined, as each provider is different, so we only display a failure. NOTE: You will also see a failure if the Kiosk is unable to communicate with the Connector. If the payment is successful, then it means that the payment has been made and the transaction has been submitted to Imagine's back-end for onward processing. It will now.

Please select the specific location for which you want to make changes. Once you have made the desired changes, click on \"Save\". Hide last sale details when the clerk is logged out - When a clerk logs out, the Last Sale Total and Change will display as 0.00 instead of showing the actual amounts. Hide chart on POS - The sales chart on the POS log-on screen will not be shown. Ask if the customer will receive a receipt as mail - When enabled, the clerk will have the option to email a receipt in addition to the POS automatically printing it. If a customer is selected and has a valid email address, the receipt will be sent to that email address when the clerk presses the 'Email Receipt' button. If this option is unchecked, a receipt will be printed automatically, but the clerk will not have the option to email it, regardless of whether a customer is selected or not. Please note that this option is overridden by the \"The receipt should be emailed instead of printed as default\" option, which always offers an email receipt option. The receipt should be emailed instead of printed as default - When enabled, the POS will not automatically print a receipt. The clerk will have the ability to manually print a receipt or send an email receipt, but not both. This option takes precedence over the \"Ask if the customer will receive a receipt as mail\" option by always offering an email receipt option. Stay logged in after finished sale - After completing a sale, the clerk will remain logged in without being prompted for their login details again. The clerk must manually log out if stepping away from the POS. Automatically aggregate identical item lines in a transaction - When this option is checked, items with the same barcode will be listed as a single line on the POS. The receipt will also display a single line with the total quantity. Allow overcharging of payment cards - Enabling this option allows for surcharges to be added to the receipt for payment cards. Only managers can do returns - By checking this option, only managers will be able to authorize returns or perform transactions that require management credentials. Refer to @ Clerk for more information. POS Discount Buttons - Use these options to customize the discount buttons on the POS according to your requirements. For more details, see Line Discount.

    "text": "The PoS Admin - Expansion menu should be used in preference to this menu, Admin will be removed in future releases and will not be accessible Introduction: The Expansion framework, accessed through the Admin > Expansions Module, allows for the configuration of third-party extensions. Typically, your K3 representative will handle the setup of these extensions if needed. The Expansion Framework enables the integration of external extensions hosted outside of the Imagine platform, providing additional functionality beyond what is currently offered by Imagine. It is primarily available for Self Serve and Simple POS applications. Typical Uses: One example of using the Expansion framework is during a transaction before payment is made. At this point, a unique identifier is sent to the third-party API, identifying the session and the basket. Imagine will open a window for the external services to interact with the user and await a completion message. The third-party application can perform custom actions, such as collecting additional information from the user or directly interacting with the Imagine basket object. Expansions offer the ability to incorporate additional functions that may not be relevant or accessible to the retailer directly. For instance, there might be a shop feature that requires K3 to set up and configure, but the retailer needs the capability to enable or disable the feature independently. Clean Cash: If Clean Cash is enabled for the tenant and shop, you can enable or disable it within the Expansion framework. Please refer to the Clean Cash notes for information on when it can be temporarily disabled.",

These items will have not been deducted from stock. It is possible to edit the Unit Cost value on a Draft vendor return, however, the edited Unit Cost only effects this individual vendor return. The edited Unit Cost does not effect related totals outside this specific vendor return such as the Last Cost for example. Value for the item is not effected by any edits to the Unit Cost here. Status: Closed - Returns have been completed and deducted from stock. To create a new Return click the \"Create New\" this will take you to the below page. Give the return a title and add the item by scanning the barcode or clicking search. To Add items manually to a goods receipt you must not have selected to receive from a purchase order. You can add items in the following way: Scan a barcode - this will add the item to the grid, if the item already exists it will increment the quantity by 1 for each scan. Find Item Manually Clicking Find Items Manually will show the Add Items modal window. From this screen you can search items based upon any of the item properties. By entering a quantity or incrementing the quantity using the +/- buttons you can populate the grid. Once all item quantities have been set select Add Items to add them to the Goods Receipt. Progress can be saved at any time by clicking Save. If you wish to cancel the changes click Back. When complete, clicking Save and Commit will change the status to Closed and remove the items from stock.

You will need to speak to your K3 consultant to enable certain features, ensure you have made arrangements for this before starting this process. Step 1 - Create Fiskaly API Keys: 1. Create an account on Fiskaly at https://dashboard.fiskaly.com/. 2. Go to the \"Settings\" section and select \"API Keys.\" 3. Click on \"Create API Key\" and provide a name for the API key. 4. Make note of the generated API Key and API Secret. Step 2 - K3 consultant to add the Fiskaly Shop Feature: Your K3 consultant will add a Shop Feature for you. They will need to know your Tenant Name or ID Let your K3 consultant know which shop(s) need Fiskaly setting up for. For each shop they will create a new shop feature with the Name, Type and Group of \"fiscalization\" with the following values: Name Type Key and Value Active boolean true microserviceurl string http://ms-fiskaly/api/v2.0/ apidetails string { \"apiKey\":\"xxxx\", \"apiSecret\":\"xxxx\", \"vatRates\": \"20,5,0\", \"skipQRPrint\":false, \"ItemDescription\":\"Parameter2\", \"ItemId\": \"Parameter3\" } NOTE: the following details are required to be passed to your K3 consultant [apiKey] - is the API Key as obtained in Step 1 [apiSecret] - is the API Secret as obtained in Step 1 [vatRates] - represents the VAT percentages used for VAT codes in Fiskaly. Where there are more than one rate these should be separated by a comma i.e. \"20,5,0\" for 20% 5% and 0% [skipQRPrint] - set skipQRPrint to true if you want to skip QR code generation and printing on the receipt. See the 'how to use Fiskaly' page [ItemDescription] - this value is \"Parameter2\" and is used to map item details from Imagine. No additional detail is required for this key [ItemId] - this value is \"Parameter3\" and is used to map item details from Imagine. No additional detail is required for this key Step 3 - Connector Setup: 1. In the POS Admin Module select \"K3 Connector Manager\" 2. Against each connector, you will find the TssGuid, Client Id, and a button to generate the Fiscalization ID. Click the button to generate the necessary IDs for Fiskaly for each desired connector. Step 4 - Create Purchaser Agency Setup: 1. In the Back Office Module select Fiskaly from the menu. 2. Click on the \"Register Purchaser Agency\" button to create a new Purchaser Agency. 3. Select the connector for which you want to create the Purchaser Agency. The address fields will be populated based on the assigned shop, but you can make changes if needed. 4. Fill in the remaining fields and click \"Register Purchaser Agency\" to create the record in Fiskaly. 5. End-of-day transactions will now be associated with this Purchaser Agency. Step 5 - Generate Settings Document: Once all connectors and purchaser agencies are registered, you can press \"Settings Document\" on the Fiskaly screen. This will generate a PDF document containing all the Fiskaly settings that have been created and set up. Step 6 - K3 consultant to configure the Docker Compose file: Your K3 consultant will need to access each connector associated with Fiskaly (Step 3 above) and check the configuration of the Docker Compose file used by the Connector. they will need to: 1. Ensure that the latest \"DeviceWorker_DeviceGateway\" image is used. 2. Add the following line to the environment variables for the \"Deviceworker_DeviceGateway\" section: NOTE: Replace [Name] with the appropriate value, and make sure to use the correct API URL. Name Value FiscalizationGwUrl ${API_URL}/Fiscalization/",

Or to advise a customer if they cannot find the exact variant they are looking for, which alternatives you have in your shop. In contrast, the Article Statistic widget shows current quantity values for the item selected in the PoS. These statistics match the same values shown in Inventory - Figures. The key use of the Article Statistic widget is to see a specific items quantities across a range of metrics over a range of shops. This is useful for a customer who is looking for a particular sized and coloured item that you do not have in stock, but you can advise of other shops that may have it. In use, when adding an item to your transaction in the POS, the Widget panel will provide you with the currently available quantity for that particular item. For example, if you see \"Stock (0200000002336),\" it means that you are using the Stock widget, and the barcode for the item is \"0200000002336.\" This information displays the amount of stock you currently have in each store (on hand), including offline stock or stock in transit. For more detailed inventory figures and statistics for this specific item, you can refer to the Article Statistic widget. You can utilise the Shops and Variants button to see other variants related to this item and their stock quantities. It allows you to also view the corresponding values in a Matrix Grid across all your shops. To see another shop you should choose from the list provided above the matrix grid. Note: only active shops will show their stock. Inactive shops will not appear in the list. Note: any inactive items will not display a quantity, like the Small Blue variant in example here. In contrast, all Large variants simply have no stock in the Brighton shop currently but are active items.",

    "text": "Upon scanning a QR code or visiting the URL, users will be directed to the Home View within the TOP application. The Home View serves as the central hub for customers to browse and select the items they wish to order through TOP. To streamline the ordering process, the TOP application always presents the Landing Group of the selected store as the starting point for navigation. This hierarchical structure and navigation can be expanded and customized according to specific requirements using the Composer Groups functionality within Visual Composer. This allows for a tailored and personalized user experience, enhancing the efficiency and flexibility of the ordering process. You can choose to drill into the subgroups (black tiles) to see another layer of the hierarchy, or you can use the +/- buttons to add your items to the basket. If you press the + on an item which is a Bundle or has Modifiers, you will be asked to make your selections before adding to the basket. TOP is aware of your current stock levels. So if you run out of stock it will display Sold Out on the Tile and will be unavailable for selection by a customer. There are various ways a customer can navigate the page. Icon Name Function Search Bar Users can utilize the Search bar to quickly find specific items they wish to add to their basket. By entering relevant keywords or item names, users can easily locate and select desired items, enhancing the efficiency of the ordering process. On Screen Navigation If you have Bundle Groups set up, you will see navigation buttons appear when in those groups. For example Home > Drinks > Pepsi / Sprite / Coke. you can use this to return to the Home Screen or a section by selecting the POS. Information Button This button will show the user your Terms and Conditions, FAQ, Delivery Information and Privacy Policy if you have them configured. Table Number It also displays the Table number which it extracts from the scanned URL. Product Information By tapping on the tile with the \"i\" symbol, users can access the supplementary information and explore any available Bundle Groups or Modifiers associated with the selected item, enhancing their overall ordering experience and allowing for further customization. Basket Button Tapping the basket button allows you to review and verify the items in your basket, ensuring accuracy and making any necessary adjustments if needed. Once you have confirmed the contents of your basket, you can proceed to the payment stage, where you will be prompted to complete the transaction.",

    "text": "Imagine and MStore K3Topsync Customer guide TABLE OF CONTENTS 1.Description 2.Imagine TOP (Table Order and Pay functions) 3.MStore side setup 4. K3TopSynch 5. Operation 6. Advice on functionality 1.Description The TOP (Table Order and Pay) Imagine application has been integrated to MStore so that it can be used as a cloud based Portal point of sale for Café/Resturant situations. This will allow customers to scan a QR code using a mobile device or smart phone which then opens a Shop related to the MStore site. Orders can be paid for online, this then creates orders in MStore specifically assigned to a Till MStore side which are then visualised on both Food prep/Kitchen and Customer facing order boards. The desired MStore items which need to exisit in Imagine TOP are marked in MStore and synchronised to Imagine via the K3TopSynch application which synchronises both Items and Transactions from TOP. There is also Membership integration where Members can validate their number to receive a membership discount on the order based on an overall percentage that is assigned in MStore Membership privileges Imagine discount percentage. 2.Imagine TOP (Table Order and Pay functions) Imagine is accessed through the customer Portal where the SelfServe Modules will have been configured and customised for the application. Imagine Portal Https://Portal.K3Imagine.com Within the Backoffice the Modules associated with TOP will be visible as below. Shop A shop can now be setup in the Backoffice/Shops Module as below example. An Email address should be included in the shop setup above as this will provide a forwarding address from which the TOP emailed receipts can be sent from Imagine. Ideally a noreply for customer purposes. Payment Provider (Self Serve Admin) A complete help link below to customer knowledge base is below. https://support.k3btg.com/en/support/solutions/articles/103000262086-stripe-setup-for-top The Stripe Payment provider will be registered by the customer The Webhook and Secret keys are provided by the registration process. https://dashboard.stripe.com/register Visual Composer A complete guide to setting up the Tiles for the online shop can accessed using the link below. https://support.k3btg.com/en/support/solutions/folders/103000304183 Accessed from SelfServe Admin Module this is where we setup the visual tiles that build the shop which is what the customer sees as a point of purchase. Example Here is what can be composed as a customer facing shop Product Configurator This is where the Items within Imagine Self Serve can be priced for promotion. This is also where the Modifier Groups are setup for the shop basket and checkout page. Here is the link to Imagine online help for detailed functionality. Example of where modifiers are shown in image below. https://support.k3btg.com/en/support/solutions/folders/103000304181 TOP (Table order and pay) Shop A QR code can now be generated which will create a url that loads the TOP shop visual pages. This can be accessed from Self Serve Admin/Shops as below. Functionality on Self Serve Admin can be found here in the Imagine online help. This is also where the Visual profiles to each of the shops can be assigned as well as Timeslots. These are explained in the online help link below. https://support.k3btg.com/en/support/solutions/articles/103000050221-top-tables 3.MStore side setup MStore Backoffice settings A Till will be setup in MStore backoffice Tills configuration an example as below. Bearing in mind printers/Depts may differ for specific customers. The Till type has to be set as “Handheld Table Ordering” Items which are required to be synched to Imagine TOP will need to be marked in MStore as example below. There is Membership Discount feature in the integration which allows members to have a set discount percentage applied to a TOP transaction. This discount is applied specifically to the member and does not allow varying discount percentages to be Item or Analysis code specific. Example setting as below in MStore backoffice membership types The membership discount/validation feature is displayed in the Basket section of the Imagine TOP as below and can be skipped if not required. MStore Order boards and customer Order Ready Boards. Although Imagine does have it’s own set of Order boards for both prep and customer these are not used for the MStore setup. MStore has it’s own applications for this purpose and since the MStore customer may also have Orders created in house on the MStore system outside of the Imagine TOP it makes sense that both in house MStore and Imagine TOP are displayed together rather than on separate boards, therefore we use the MStore applications for this purpose. PkitchenDisplay This is the board that displays the prep/Kitchen orders that are generated from both MStore (in house) and TOP. It’s configuration is set in the MStore.ini file located in C:\\programdata\\merac and as can be seen below defines rows, column sizes,Dept, Prep area and font size. The Dept for each customer will be the related dept set in MStore Backoffice for this example we can see that the Till 7000 is set to Sootys Diner Dept which is 47. The KitchenOrderPrep value 1 is set as the initial prep area defined in the K3Topsync settings. Example of PKitchenDisplay, clicking into the order let’s you progress the order and also print if required to kitchen printer or quit. FoodOrderDisplay This is the customer facing board which takes it’s settings from C:\\Program Files\\Merac\\FoodOrderDisplay.exe.config This is an xml file which will be setup as part of the implementation. This will display as below 4. K3TopSynch K3TopSync v1.01 is an application which integrates MStore with the K3|TOP online selling portal. Using the K3TOPSYNC application When launching the program normally, you get the option to sync products or transactions. For a transaction sync, you must choose a date range. The program defaults to yesterday. You should not download “today’s” transactions unless you are sure there will be no more transactions, otherwise a duplicate cashdrawer would be created. You can choose a date span if you like. Any transactions already downloaded will be ignored. Once all transactions are downloaded, the program runs a database procedure which created cashdrawers for each new day with transactions. When syncing products, any PLU which has been ticked to go to K3|TOP will be uploaded. If the product already exists in K3|TOP, its record will be updated. Configuration changes to K3TopSynch can be made from Tools/Configuration These settings will have been set during implementation but it is possible that Polling times may want to be modified to optomise orders. E.g. 5. Operation a: Create all Items in MStore including complete meals and modifiers. b: For purposes of membership check Imagine discount settings in membership priviledge schemes in MStore. c: Run the K3 K3Topsync app and it will create the Items in Imagine that have been marked as Imagine in MStore. d: Load the TOP store in either a browser or a mobile using the shop QR code or url generated in SelfServe Admin/Shops e: Make a purchase using the TOP app and wait for the K3TopSync polling to finish synching transactions. f: Run the PKitchen.exe and check the order has appeared also check the Foodorderdisplay.exe board to show “preparing” now complete the order in the PKitchen.exe display, Foodorderdisplay changes to “Please Collect” g: The assigned TOP Till in MStore can be finalized as normal MStore operations. 6. Advice on functionality Not all of the Imagine Self Serve functionality applies to this implementation. TOP is purely meant to be used as a selling portal to MStore items. Bundles and Bundle Groups functionality will not be synched back to MStore and is therefore redundant. Any bundled items or meals need to be created in MStore. Imagine order boards could be used but crucially will only show Imagine orders and not orders created in MStore. TOP Timeslot functionality does work and affects the MStore order boards. Item descriptions in MStore are taken from the extended description and synched to the description in Imagine TOP to allow greater flexibility. Membership discounting is on a transaction level and so applies a fixed percentage to the transaction and doesn’t work in the same way that MStore discounts do where they can be applied at a Item and Analysis code level.",

Additional information: The file is consistently named 'Item_ImportTemplate'. In the event of downloading multiple templates, a number is appended to the template's name to ensure they are not overwritten. These numbers are added in sequential order, such as (1), (2), (3), and so on. If you are working with numerous import files, it is advisable to rename the file to something more descriptive. This practice helps in better organizing and identifying the import files. Please note that it is recommended to avoid using spaces in the filename, as the import program will add plus signs between the words. For instance, 'Items+with+dimensions.xlsx'. Feel free to relocate the import file to a more suitable location than the default download area.",

    "title": "Step 2 Fixed Selection Fields",
    "text": "Within the Excel Template file, certain fields are populated with drop-down selections based on the information stored in Imagine. Additionally, some fields will only appear if they are enabled and set as required in Imagine. It is crucial to carefully review the items to be imported and ensure that the necessary information is set up in Imagine beforehand. Manual addition of these values to the spreadsheet is not possible. Here are some specific details regarding the fields: Vendors - These need to be set up in Imagine to appear in the drop-down list within the template. Hierarchy Nodes (Departments/Categories) - These also need to be set up in Imagine for them to appear in the drop-down list within the template. Tax Rates - Each Tax Group will be displayed as a separate field and present a list of available tax codes in their respective drop-down lists. For example, a UK Tax Group may show options like 20% and 0%, a French Tax Group may display 23% and 5%, and an Irish Tax Group may show 23%, 15%, and 0%. Dimension Types - This column refers solely to the type of dimension, such as Color, Size, or Fit-Width. Each dimension type will have its column at the end of the import template. Please note that this should not be confused with Dimension Templates. Custom Attributes - Only Custom Attributes marked as required will be shown in the template for input. Prices - The Selling Price for each currency will be included as an available field, based on the currencies set up against a particular Shop. Take care to ensure that the necessary data is properly set up in Imagine before using the import template, as this will ensure accurate and comprehensive information can be imported. The tabs at the bottom of the template contain the data used by the drop-down menus. These cannot be edited but are useful to see what is available from each of the drop-down selections.",

    "text": "When you first open the template file, you may see a protected view warning, click ‘Enable Editing’ and then you are ready to start adding item information. The template spreadsheet can be used for items with and without dimensions [Colours/sizes] and can contain a mixture of both. Field Information An item with No Dimensions - All information about the item will be entered on one line. When updating an Item with No Dimensions the Master Item information shown on the Summary tab will be matched up to the Item information as shown on the Matrix tab. An item with Dimensions - There will be multiple lines for this item, each line representing the colour/size combination. The Master Item Number must be the same for all lines for the item to be created properly with all the colours/sizes required. Requirements The Master Item Number (MIN) must be the same for each dimension variation of the item (e.g., Colour, Size, Fit). SKT01 in the example covers all dimensions of the Skye Tee Shirt. Item Number (IN) and Barcode (BC) must be unique for each dimension variation. If an item does not have a manufacturer's barcode, you must add one to the item. This could be the same as the Item Number [IN] field or your own internally generated number. E.g. 200001 or 201000345. If using a number structure please ensure you are consistent, and the number is unique. Contact your K3 project consultant for further advice if required. Dimension Details must be a unique combination covering all dimensions used for example if an item has 2 Dimensions, you cannot have Blue and Small together for more than 1 dimension variation. The Vendor must be the same for all dimension variations as per the Item [Master Item Number]. For all other fields, it is possible to make changes per dimension variation, but beware of how it may appear in Imagine, per dimension variation.",

Submit the Sheet to start the first part of the import process. Use the browse for Excel Spread Sheet to find the sheet to import, then click submit sheet. The status “Processing” means the file is being checked, and then it moves to ‘validating’. If successful it will move to a status of ‘Validated’ with an Edit Pencil and Tick icon showing in the Actions column. If there is a problem, it will move to an ‘Invalid’ Status. [See Invalid Status section on what to do next] If there is no activity after a short period, use the Refresh List button to refresh the page. Processing and Validation time will vary based on the number of items and lines being imported. [Optional] Review of Validated items. When the status shows validated, the Edit Pencil can be used to review any of the items before completing the Import process. Items can be changed using the Edit pencil of each line, or if required items deleted using the recycle bin of each line. You must choose the ‘Validate’ button again if any changes are made, otherwise use the X to close the page, ready to ‘Complete the Import’. [If required] Validation Errors - Invalid Status. Invalid status means there is something not quite right with the data in the spreadsheet. Typically, it is missing information, or duplicated information such as the item number, a barcode or dimension variations. Some corrections can be made at this validation stage without re-importing the spreadsheet, others may require a spreadsheet change followed by another import. In the Actions column, click on the Edit Pencil to see exactly what the problem is and apply the correction. The items shown in RED are the items that require attention. Click on the down arrow at the start of each line to see the Validation Error message. [There may be more than 1 validation message per line] In this example, the Manufacturer Items Number is missing. Option 1: Update the spreadsheet and re-import again. Option 2: Click on the Edit Pencil between the arrow and the recycle bin to add the missing information. Use the SAVE icon between the down arrow and recycle bin to save your changes for this line. Repeat option 2 for all other lines showing in Red. Once all corrections are made, choose VALIDATE to re-validate the data. The status will show Validating then move to ‘Validated’ with an Edit Pencil and Tick icon showing in the Actions column if successful. If there is still a problem, it will move back to an ‘Invalid’ Status. If there is no activity after a short period, use the Refresh List button to refresh the page. Processing and Validation time will vary based on the number of items and lines being imported. Continue with the next step to ‘Complete the Import’. Export Validation Errors In the event there are a lot of errors, use the ‘Export All Data’ option to export to a spreadsheet for easier identification. The spreadsheet will be downloaded to the download folder or your specified download location.",

As an item can have multiple attributes, it is necessary to specify which attribute value to print using the variable. The Custom Attribute variable requires a single argument, which is the that defines the Custom Attribute ID to use. On the printed label, the data in the Value field of the specified Custom Attribute for that item will be printed. Custom Variables are structured as {customAttribute|} To use this variable, you need to replace with the actual ID of the custom attribute you want to print. The pipe character (|) must be used to separate the variable name from the argument. You can find the IDs of all custom attributes listed on the Custom Attribute overview page under Item - Custom Attributes. The variable will then print the value of the specified custom attribute for the item on the label. To insert the correct Custom Attribute variable on the label template, simply place the cursor where you want the variable and select it from the Custom Attribute list. The variable and argument will be inserted for you. Dimension Variable The Dimension variable prints the value of dimensions for an item. You need to specify which dimension value to print since an item can have multiple dimensions. To determine the range of dimensions for an item, check the Matrix tab for that item. The Dimension view also displays the values applied to an item. The Dimension variable requires a single argument , which indicates the Dimension Sequence ID to use. You can find Dimension Sequences in the Dimension view of the Matrix tab for the item. The ID of the far left-hand Dimension Sequence is 1, and the ID of the far right-hand column is 10. Select the current Dimension Sequence for the argument. Dimension Variables are structured as {dimension|} To use the Dimension variable, replace the argument with the value of the Dimension Sequence ID to print. The resulting label will show the value given for the item at the associated Dimension Sequence ID. The pipe character (|) should be used to delimit the variable name from the argument. Sales Price Variable The Sales Price variable allows you to display the value of an item in different currencies on the label. To specify which currency to print, you need to use the argument. This argument must be ISO 4217 compliant and can only be one of the currencies listed in the Matrix tab for the item. The available currencies are part of the value selectors and are labeled as \"Sales Price.\" The variable is structured as: {salesPrice|} To create the label, replace the argument with the 3-letter currency code of the currency you want to print. The label will display the value of the item in the corresponding currency field shown in the Matrix tab. Be sure to use the pipe character (|) to separate the variable name from the argument.",

    "title": "Create a Modifier Group",
    "text": "TABLE OF CONTENTS Modifier Groups Modifier Groups List Create a Modifier Group Number Picker Example. Modifier Groups Modifier Groups enable you to apply certain prescribed modifications to an Item. Note that you can only modify an Item or a Bundle Main item, but not a Bundle Group Item. You would use a Modifier Group if you wish to add one or more variable modifiers to a particular item. Modifiers can have additional prices added on top of the item price. For instance, suppose you order a cup of coffee. You choose a Latte but would also like to select your preferred type of milk, an extra shot of espresso, and a flavour of syrup. This would require three modifier groups: \"Milk\": This Modifier Group lists the milk options available, such as Semi Skimmed, Skimmed, Whole, Oat, Soy, and Almond. \"Shots\": This Modifier Group includes the optional extra shots available. \"Syrups\": This Modifier Group provides the syrup choices. Please note that Modifiers are not currently linked to Items within Imagine and do not affect the stock. Modifiers appear in the front-end apps, similar to the example shown below: Modifier Groups List A Modifier Group List displays all the existing Modifier Groups that you have currently set up. From this list, you can create new Modifier Groups or select an existing one to view or edit its details. Note that you cannot delete Modifier Groups, as they may be linked to other groups for which sales have already been registered. Create a Modifier Group To begin creating modifiers use the This will then open up to the page below. Number Picker Uses a +/- button to increase and decrease selection amounts. Can be used for items like \"Extra Shot\". Checkbox Buttons Uses tick boxes for selections. Can be used for items like a sandwich with different fillings like lettuce, tomatoes or onion. Name The name is used internally. Display Name The name is seen by front-end users. Number Picker Example. You can add/edit as many different number pickers into your Modifier Group as required within the table. To add more modifiers use the to add a new line. Image Enter a URL for an image to be shown against the modifier in the front-end apps. Only .bmp, .gif, .jpg and .svg type images are supported. Name The name of the modifier as it appears in the front-end apps. ItemNo Used for integration purposes, you can link a modifier to an existing Imagine item which can then be related to a third-party ERP system item. Default Value The number you get by default upon selection. Min The minimum value you can enter for the modifier. Max The maximum number allowed to be entered for the modifier. Sales Price Optional sales prices for modifiers that get added to the price from the default value. As an example, suppose you have set a default value of 1 for shots, and each additional shot costs £1.10. In this case, the price for each shot added will be added to the item price. However, if the default value is 1, but you have set the minimum value to 0, then the price will not be subtracted if the default shot is removed. This means that the customer cannot lower the base price of the item by removing the modifiers. Ensure you save the individual rows before trying to add a new row or save the group. it will only save changes which have been individually saved in that table. Example Coffee Price: £3.00 Shot Price: £1.00 Default Shots: 2 Minimum Shots: 1 Number Of Shots Coffee Total Price Reason 1 £3.00 The base price is £3.00 and they have removed 1 shot, but you do not have the cost of the shot removed for your default shots. 2 £3.00 The default number of shots, therefore default coffee price applies. 3 £4.00 2 default shots are included in the price, and 1 additional shot for £1. 4 £5.00 2 default shots included in the price, s additional shots for £2. Checkbox Button Example. Checkbox Buttons are a type of modifier that allows you to provide one or more selectable options to customers, both as optional or mandatory selections. They are called Checkbox Buttons because they appear as clickable buttons that resemble checkboxes, which can be easily selected with a touch screen. These are particularly useful for providing choices of fillings for sandwiches or toppings for pizzas, for example. Customers can select one or more options or none of them, depending on their preferences. Name This should be the name used internally. Display Name This should be the name seen by front-end users. Min The minimum value you can enter for the modifier. Max The maximum number allowed to be entered for the modifier Checkbox Buttons are a way to offer optional or mandatory selections to customers, where they can choose one or more options from a list. If the modifier is not mandatory, the minimum value should always be 0, while if you want to ensure that at least one modifier is always selected, set the minimum to 1. The maximum value is typically set to 1, to limit the number of selections to one per group. However, for optional toppings, you may choose to set a higher limit. To create or modify modifiers, use the table below. You can add, delete, or modify rows as needed. Remember to save each row before attempting to add a new one or save the group, as changes are only saved for rows that have been individually saved within the table. Image Enter an image URL this will be shown against the modifier at the front end. NOTE: Only .bmp / .gif / .jpg /.svg image types are supported. Name The name of the modifier as it appears in the front-end apps. ItemNo Used for integration purposes, you can link a modifier to an existing Imagine item which can then be related to a third-party ERP system item. Default Value - If the button is selected by default. For example, in a Latte case, you might have Semi Skimmed selected by default. Sales Price Optional sales prices for modifiers that get added to the price of the default value. When you select a syrup for your coffee, an additional charge of £0.50 will be added to the item price. However, if the syrup is set as a default selection, the charge for it will not be subtracted from the item price. You can also set higher prices for more premium modifiers to increase revenue. Keep in mind that any additional charges for modifiers will be added to the item price, so the final price of the item may vary based on the selections made.",

    "title": "Composer View",
    "text": "The Composer View serves as the primary screen within the application, where clerks can efficiently select the items that customers wish to order. When accessing the Composer View, the screen always starts by displaying the Landing Group specific to the selected store. This Landing Group serves as the initial point for navigation, providing a structured hierarchy of available items. For further customization and expansion of the hierarchy and navigation, the Composer Groups and Visual Composer Modules can be utilized. Within the Composer View, there are two main methods of item selection. Firstly, you can drill into the subgroups represented by blue tiles, allowing you to navigate to a deeper layer of the hierarchy to find specific items. Alternatively, you can use the +/- buttons to directly add items to the basket without navigating through the subgroups. If you select the \"+\" button for an item that is either a Bundle or has Modifiers, you will be prompted to make the necessary selections before adding the item to the basket. This ensures that any additional choices or modifications associated with the item are properly accounted for. By leveraging the capabilities of the Composer View, clerks can efficiently navigate through the item hierarchy, make selections, and add items to the basket, ensuring a streamlined and personalized ordering process for customers. Icon Meaning Function On Screen Navigation If you have Bundle Groups set up, you will see navigation buttons appear when in those groups. For example Home > Drinks > Pepsi / Sprite / Coke. you can use this to return to the Home Screen or to a section by selecting on the POS. Tile Button The tile button if pressed will return you back to your home group from wherever you are in the application. Supervisor Functions This button will ask you for a PIN code to enter supervisor functions. Product Information Any tile with the i symbol means there is some more information you might want to see for an item. It also indicates that there may be Bundle Groups or Modifiers for the item when selected. Basket Button The basket button shows you how many items you have in your basket. You can press the button to view the basket, which you have to do in order to proceed to Payment.",

    "text": "To access the Supervisor Functions locate the settings cog in the top right-hand of the POS, you will be prompted to enter a supervisor PIN. Supervisor permissions are set up in Configuration. The Simple POS application provides several additional functions accessible through the following options: Previous Receipt: This option allows you to view the previous receipt and provides the choice to either email or print it for reference or record-keeping purposes. Full Screen: The Full Screen option allows you to toggle between full-screen mode and regular view. However, please note that this function may not be supported in Chrome due to specific browser settings. Choose Payment Provider: This functionality lists all the payment providers that you have configured in the administration settings. If you are conducting a demo or test and do not have an active payment provider, you can use the Virtual option. The Virtual payment method bypasses actual payment processing and assumes a full payment has been made. However, it should be noted that the Virtual option should not be used in a live environment. Refund Mode: By selecting the Refund Mode option, you can switch the application into refund mode. This mode allows you to process the entire transaction as a refund, accommodating situations where a customer needs to return a purchased item or seek a refund for a specific transaction. Logout: Choosing the Logout option clears the current basket, effectively emptying it, and returns you to the login screen, allowing for secure user logout and ensuring the privacy of customer information. By providing these additional functions, the Simple POS application enhances the user experience, offering convenient options for managing receipts, adjusting display settings, selecting payment providers, handling refunds, and securely logging out from the application.",

    "text": "When adding a Bundle or Modifiable item to your basket in the Simple POS application, you will be guided through the selection process to ensure the relevant choices are made before adding the item to your basket. If the Bundle main item has associated Modifiers linked to it, the application will automatically navigate you to the Modifiers tab, providing the opportunity to make any desired alterations or customization to the selected item. This ensures that you have the flexibility to modify the Bundle according to your preferences or specific requirements. By prompting you to make relevant selections and automatically directing you to the Modifiers tab when applicable, the Simple POS application streamlines the ordering process, enabling you to create a personalized bundle that suits your preferences and needs. For non-bundled items in the Simple POS application that have Modifiers associated with them, the interface will focus solely on displaying the Modifiers to streamline the selection process. Next to each Modifier title, you will find the minimum and maximum selection rules, indicating the allowable quantity or range of choices for that particular Modifier. Additionally, any associated additional prices for the selected Modifiers will be displayed, providing transparency on any cost adjustments. It's important to note that any modifications or selections you make during the ordering process will be recorded and included on the order confirmation slip. These modifications will also be transmitted to the Order Status Display, which is used in the order preparation area. This ensures that the preparation team is aware of the specific modifications and requirements associated with each order, facilitating efficient and accurate order fulfillment. By focusing on Modifiers for non-bundled items, providing clear rules and prices, and incorporating modifications into the order confirmation and preparation processes, the Simple POS application enables seamless customization and ensures accurate communication between clerks, customers, and the order preparation team.",

    "text": "TABLE OF CONTENTS Basket Payment Refund Mode Discount Basket The Basket screen shows a concise list of your items, including any bundle choices and modifiers you've made. Similar items with the same selections and modifiers are grouped on a single line. Each line indicates the total price for that group, along with the quantity multiplied by the price of a single item. Edit Line - You can use the pencil icon for the basket line to make alterations to that line (change modifiers or bundle selections). Delete Line -Use the trash can icon to remove the line from the basket. Delete Basket - Use the black trash can next to the Pay button to clear the basket and return to the start screen. Payment At the bottom of the Basket screen, you will have your payment options. You can choose your payment method to use and you can split your payment types in use as well. For a Card payment, the system will establish communication with the configured Connector specifically designed for processing real EFT payments. Similarly, a Cash payment will also utilize the connector to trigger the opening of the cash drawer. On the other hand, a Manual Card payment does not require an integrated card terminal. It is intended for use with standalone chip and pin devices and only utilizes the connector for receipt printing. If a payment fails, you will receive a notification and after a 5-second delay, you will be directed back to the basket to try another card. To obtain detailed information about why the transaction was declined, please refer to the PED (Payment Entry Device) documentation, as each provider may have different reasons for displaying a failure. Please note that a failure message may also appear if the Simple POS is unable to establish communication with the Connector. Upon successful payment, the transaction will be sent to Imagine's back end for further processing. The system will: Submit the order to the Order Status Display. Provide you with an order number, which will be displayed on the screen and used in the OSD (Order Status Display) and ORB (Order Receipt Builder). Print an order confirmation slip that includes the order number, as well as any bundle selections and modifiers that have been applied. Show you the estimated waiting time, which is calculated based on the order throughput of the last 15 minutes. Finally, you will be returned to the start screen to proceed with other actions. Refund Mode The Supervisor Functions include a Refund mode, which is specifically designed for processing refunds. When you activate Refund mode, the entire transaction is treated as a refund, and the system does not allow for exchanges to be performed. The user interface indicates when you are in Refund mode to ensure that you are aware and prevent any potential mistakes. This clarity helps to maintain accuracy and avoid errors during the refund process. Discount After registering an item against the POS there are options available to discount them. These options will be detailed below. Clicking one of these will set the percentage discount against the item(s) in the basket. Clicking on ‘Custom Discount’ brings up a dialogue allowing the users to choose to discount by a percentage or a set amount. Once the discount has been entered press ‘Apply Discount’. This will then set the amount or percentage against the product in the basket.",

    "text": "During the import process, Imagine will perform some validation on the contents of the file, particularly the external files. A failed status means that one or more of the values are incorrect or not recognised. Click the Edit Pencil in the Actions box to see what why it has failed. If no data is displayed, then check the delimiter/quotes/column index settings and within the import file itself. Example of No Data Displayed Example of Validation Failed with Data. State Advises the status of the imported line. OK Item imported successfully. Warning Item imported but advises additional information about the item. e.g., Item is not part of the original stocktake list. Error Item is not imported and advises why. e.g., the barcode does not exist. Message Count This is how many error or warning messages are against an item. Row Number Where the item is located within the import file. Useful when the file has lots of items. Barcode The barcode number from the file. It is possible to amend the barcode from here if required. Description Item description/ name if it's available (Imagine Excel file only). Vendor Item Number Vendor item number if it's available (Imagine Excel file only). Count The count quantity from the import file. It is possible to change the quantity if required. Quantity should be limited to a maximum value of 10 digits (i.e., 9999999999) and up to a maximum of 2 decimals (i.e., 99999999.99). The minimum value should be 0. Recycle Bin An item can be removed from the import list before trying to validate again. NOTE: An item is not deleted from the original file, only this import area allows you to continue with the import process. Validate Import After removing an item or making changes to the barcode field, use this button to try the import again. Validation Messages Click the arrow to the left of the State field to expand or collapse the Validation Message area. In the example below, there are 2 messages: 1 error and 1 warning. Use this information to check and make changes to the import file or this import list. Alternatively, delete the line item. Once ready, choose Validate Import to try the import again.",

    "text": "To group detailed data in the Movement Data Table, follow these steps: Click and hold the header you want to group by (e.g., \"Shop\"), and drag it into place. If you want to remove a column header from the grouping, perform the reverse action by dragging it from its position and dropping it back into the table where you want the header to be placed. Notes The table will automatically update as you add, remove and alter positions of the headers. Headers placed furthest to the left will automatically be the major grouping, whilst headers further to the right will be subsequently more minor groupings. The example below explains this in more detail. Columns that display variable digital denominations, large blocks of text and other limitations cannot be grouped. You will not be able to drop these headers in the 'drag and drop' area. In Movements examples of the headers that cannot be grouped are: Cost (tenant) Cost (shop) Qty Item Description Master Item Description Example of grouping with a single column: Once you group the data, the Movement Data Table will display the information in a different format, showing the groups. In this case, it will be grouped by \"Shops.\" You can use the arrow next to each shop's name to expand and view more detailed information. Example of grouping with multiple columns: If you choose multiple headers to group by, you will have a stack of groups. For example, you may have \"Shops\" as the major header, and within each shop, you can further group by \"Date\". To change the hierarchy of the data, arrange the groups in the desired order. The data will stack based on the order of the groups you arrange with major priority to the left, moving to minor priority as you move to the right.",

    "title": "How to setup and use Clean Cash ",
    "text": "TABLE OF CONTENTS Clean Cash Usage Setup Clean Cash Clean Cash is a fiscalization system used in Sweden to ensure proper registration of all sales in stores with the Swedish tax authorities. It ensures that transactions are properly recorded and accounted for, minimizing the risk of cash manipulation or fraud. The process involves the following steps: 1. Sale Details: When a sale is made in a store, the transaction details are sent to the Clean Cash system. 2. Control Code Generation: Clean Cash generates a control code for the sale transaction. 3. Physical Receipt Printing: The control code is printed on the physical receipt, ensuring its presence as a legal requirement. 4. Back Office Storage: The control code is saved and associated with the corresponding sale transaction in the store's back office system. 5. Compliance Requirement: It is illegal to complete sales in Sweden without the control code on the receipt. Stores can face fines and penalties if this requirement is not met. By utilizing Clean Cash, stores in Sweden can adhere to fiscal regulations, ensuring accurate and transparent reporting of sales to the tax authorities. Usage POS Startup: When Clean Cash is enabled for a store (as per the setup process), the POS system performs a connection check during the Clerk's login. If the connection to Clean Cash cannot be established, an error message will be displayed, and the login attempt will be blocked. This means that it will not be possible to proceed with sales. In such cases, it is possible to temporarily disable Clean Cash in the Admin - Expansions section. Making a Sale: When a sale payment is completed, a request is sent to Clean Cash before the receipt is printed. The details of the sale, including transaction information, are sent to Clean Cash. In return, a QR code is generated and automatically printed on the receipt. Note: In case there are technical difficulties and a QR code is not returned within the specified timeout period, the sale will still be completed. This is because the customer's payment has already been processed at this stage, and an automatic reversal may not be possible. Setup Set up Clean Cash, there are several stages involved. Normally, the setup is handled by K3, but it can be disabled by an admin user if needed. Here are the steps for setting up Clean Cash: 1. Shop Feature Configuration (K3 only): Configure a Shop Feature called \"CleanCash\" under Platform Admin Tenants - Shop Features. This feature requires two specific values to be set: Name Type Value Comments Active Boolean True Indicates whether clean cash should be used in the shop. ConnectorOptions JSON [{“mac”:””, “retailId”:””}] A list of connector macs matched with retailIds from Clean Cash The MAC address should be separated with dashes (-) i.e. 12-34-56-78-90-AB, using other separators such as underscores ( _ ) will cause an issue when setting up the configuration. Any letters required can be in upper or lowercase. The retail id is supplied by the Swedish tax authorities when the POS is registered, this process is usually handled by the K3 Consultant. 2. Disable and Enable Clean Cash after setup: In the Admin - Expansions section, an admin user can enable or disable Clean Cash functionality. When Clean Cash is disabled, no checks will be performed on the POS, and no receipt codes will be requested. Disabling Clean Cash should only be done temporarily if there is an issue with the Clean Cash service itself, which prevents sales. It is important to note that trading without Clean Cash in Sweden is generally considered illegal, and it is at the retailer's discretion to disable it. K3 cannot be held accountable for any consequences arising from the decision to disable Clean Cash. It is essential to ensure proper setup and compliance with Clean Cash regulations when using it in a Swedish retail environment.",

When they then register additional cash registers for the same control unit, they use the identity code and not the control unit's ID.

    "text": "TABLE OF CONTENTS Adding a New Company Editing an Existing Company Associating a Shop with an Alternative Company A self-contained legal business entity is referred to as a Company, which can be associated with one or more locations (Shops). Nevertheless, a single location can only be linked to a single company. To illustrate, if a business encompasses various shop types such as High Street, Concession, Franchise, and plans to have Outlet shops in the future, it would be logical to establish four separate companies and assign each shop to precisely one location. Adding a New Company Step 1: To begin adding a new company you can either use the \"Add Company\" or \"+Add Company\" buttons. Step 2: Provide a name for the Company and indicate the locations you need. Then, enter the Tax Number and choose the preferred currency. Name The name was given to the Company you are creating. Location Select from the drop-down which locations you wish to assign this company to. Tax Number This is the Tax Number assigned to this Company. Currency Select the relevant Currency using the drop-down. Step 3: Your added company will now be listed along with a drop-down of its locations (shops). Editing an Existing Company Delete: Deleting the Company will prompt a pop-up to appear, giving you the option to reassign the associated shops to another location. If there are no locations set up, a default company will be used. Once you confirm the selection, the Company will be deleted. Edit: You have the option to modify the Company's Name and Tax number. However, if a Shop is assigned to the Company, it is not possible to change the Currency. Associating a Shop with an Alternative Company Use the Drag and Drop icon to associate a Shop with an alternative Company. This is useful if you did not associate the Shop with the Company when creating the Company.",

It is important to know them and how they are used. Items - These are basic items that will have been created in the Inventory module. Here, you configure additional properties that are only related to Self-Serve apps. Your item can be used as a Main item within a Bundle or as a selectable item in a Bundle Group. This is also where you assign any Modifier Groups to the item. Bundles - These are groups of items that you can sell together. A typical example would be a 'Meal Deal'. You select a main item and then make a selection from one or more Bundle Groups to build your meal. Taking the Meal Deal example, your main item would be a sandwich. Then, from one Bundle Group, you would pick a snack, and from another Bundle Group, you would choose a drink. Bundle Groups - These are groupings of similar items from which you would be expected to make a selection. For example, you might have a selection of snacks to choose from. Bundle Group selections have to be items and can only be linked to Bundles. Modifier Groups - These provide you with the opportunity to make certain prescribed modifications to an Item. You can only make modifications to an Item or a Bundle Main item, not a Bundle Group Item. An example of a modification would be choosing between white or brown bread for your sandwich. Below explains the relationships of supported types which can be added as a Composer Tile for your self-serve apps. Using the Meal Deal example to explain the relationships. Item = [Sandwich] Modifier Group = [white or brown bread] Bundle = [Meal Deal of sandwich with snack and drink] Item = [Sandwich] Modifier Group = [white or brown bread] Bundle Group = [Snack] Item A = [Crisps] Item B = [Popcorn] Item C = [Nuts] Bundle Group = [Drink] Item D = [Cola] Item E = [Lemonade] The Example below is of a Bundle which has Modifier Groups linked to the main item. You have a tab for your Selections and a tab for your Modifiers. If you were to just select the main item, you would only see the Modifiers.",
