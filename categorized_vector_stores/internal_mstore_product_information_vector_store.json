    "title": "Website CSS",
    "text": "Historically, when we have developed customer ticketing sites to be inline with their \"main\" site, we have hotlinked/referenced to their own CSS files, hosted on their own servers. This has previously brought benefits - in that they can control their stylesheets, which will downstream to our ticketing site be reflected to us with no change required by us, so it is simple and cost effective. However this is a double edged sword. Our site and some javascript depends on certain CSS classes and properties being certain ways. This means that customers can, inadvertently, break their ticketing site. This causes a huge amount of pain for all inolved. The end customer cannot book tickets which causes a revenue effect. The client/attraction questions us as to why we made changes without them asking (which we didn't) and it costs us time supporting/fixing things. Recently these issues have become more frequent to the point the drawbacks heavily outweigh the pros. As such the policy now is that we will host a copy of the CSS ourselves. This means that, if they want to make changes to the styling, they have to do so through a change request with us. We will not be proactively changing these as the cost to do so would be too significant, however if it meets the following criteria we will implement the change Website Reskin Mini website reskin where navigation and or simple styling changes are done. Normally for jobs 3 hours and above. Upgrading from version 1.0 to 1.5. We won’t be looking for any convoluted over engineered solution. We are simply going to take them, host them and use them in future. This is the only way to ensure that Customers will no longer be able to impact the quality and stability of our web offering and cause us reputational damage. Customer version of this article which you can refer any customer queries to is How does styling work for the Ticketing pages?",

Replacing the current “Invalid Voucher” with text suggesting trying again, if still fails, call a number. Note: - It is known if a basket contains multiple types of ticket, it won’t handle every possibility. For example, Membership first, then and event, we store the membership page ID as such if they attempt to use an event voucher it will not allow and suggest try again/call. Importantly these exceptions will result in them needing to call rather than allowing the wrong vouchers.",

    "title": "Digital Wallets",
    "text": "This feature enables Google and Apple Wallet pages to be used with our e-commerce ticketing. Websites will need to undergo enhancements to have this feature added. It can be applied to V1 and V1.5 Websites. One it has been added there will be two options within the website admin config. Each of the options will allow the customer to change the pictures that are passed to the wallets data. We would expect customers to change the descriptions but not the values pulled from our system. We have created the options to make it easier and more Customisable as customers require changes. For a customer to start receiving these passes as part of the email they receive. The emails can be modified to with two new merge fields. If they do not want the passes to be available on certain types of bookings. This can be done by not including them in the email template the customer receives. We have written an API to allow the passing of this information for all our customers to a single point and using our certificates. With this in place, the customer configuration involvement is minimal. Examples: Booking reference along the top as normal. If the customer uses unique tickets and the merge tag is on the email and this feature is turned on with the merge tag on the email. It will show a a digital wallet option for the individual ticket. This allow entry or validation on a per ticket basis. The code being sent is the unique ticket reference. There is an option at the bottom to add a digital wallet for the whole booking. The QR Code that is associated with the pass will be the booking reference. If using unique tickets the pass shows the ticket info and individual quantity. The total quantity is shown which in this case indicates 1/2 tickets. If using the booking reference, there will be no ticket information, no quantity. The total Qty is shown for the number of booked items. The code is the booking reference. Key important information in this summary view is the date, template description, the total quantity, the time and the booking reference. The time is that of when they are intending to arrive or if they use general timeslots for all day. It is suggested \"Time\" be changed to \"Opening Time\" or similar in the options listed above. Digital Wallets for Memberships: Configuration for memberships is separate to bookings. The descriptions can be modified, for example some of our customers would prefer annual pass type or holder name etc. The email template will need to use the merge tag: It is a standard tag to show details of each membership on screen separately. If the tag is present and the site is using digital wallets the attachments for memberships (apple) or the google wallet option will appear. Key points to note: 1) In my screenshots above it only shows Google Wallet, that is because the screens were taken on an android device. If on an apple device it apple pass attachments as part of the email they receive. 2) This is not intended to show price, be a receipt or be a breakdown of an itinerary. It is PASS. 3) Digital Wallets for memberships extend current functionality and doesn't change it. Temporary card numbers, real card numbers will depend on their onsite configurations. This just extends the card numbers will have already received to their digital wallets. Finer points of card numbers is outside the scope of this work and is just standard setup advice.",

It will show the version. When supporting the device it is important to know the version. It allows for testing connection to it's local database on the phone, the remote database it connects to and allows for showing logs. Logs will appear on screen. The app will log everything it does. It will show the SQL each time to make errors easier to diagnose. The user can then share them using the normal apps on the phone. As of version 1.2.2 onwards there is an archive function.

Details look like: Restore will be grayed out if the device is current mid activity/function By clicking restore and confirming, the data will be back on the device as it was prior to upload. The contents can be seen, the data can be edited and resubmitted. This does not delete any of the previous submissions. Anything restored will be removed the achieve and be placed back with new information such as upload times etc. A useful tool for allowing users to reupload data alongside support deleting the data from the server if needed as part of a support issue. 06-01-2025- Feature enhancement - Version 1.3.0 A new feature has been added to allow replacing stock using the check stock function. A new button has been added to the bottom once an item has been scanned. Allowing replacing the stock quantities on items and updating them. This will add a zeroise prior and add the new quantity for the chosen location/s. This is the same as when performed from the back office. This feature can only be used online. It does not place data in to an inspection holding area. Changes made will be be done immediately and can be seen from within the stock audit as normal. This concludes the tweaks to the MTab application for stocking in MStore.",

Membership is created. Member card number will be the chosen one set on the affiliates setup. Affiliates code is entered in the system option that enables the functionality. Details of the member will display at the bottom left corner as normal. This information is retrieved from Digitickets. Any discount set on the Affiliates membership type setup above will trigger. Memberships will be recorded in the database under the affiliates member. No personal member data will be stored in the MStore database. Reports do not reflect this data. It will be exported via ad hoc procedure or custom report. Date/Times, transaction numbers, card numbers and response descriptions are stored in the affiliateactivity table. Latest Affiliates is required for this functionality. Affiliates \"PLUS\" is similar to Affiliates however there is no need to press a button to trigger a form, then scan cards then process them via another button click. This integration allows scanning cards in the same way they do if they were stored in MStore. New forms can be used to remove merge fields that won't be retrieved from Digitickets.

    "text": "New setting has been created in the latest release that allows control over the heartbeat monitor for the service. Rather than checking every second if it is time to run, it can be configured to only check every X number of seconds. This setting is to prevent setups that cause strain on customers servers. Checking every hour seems more reasonable and also prevents silly configuration such as run every 5 minutes. It will only run when this heart beat checks.",
