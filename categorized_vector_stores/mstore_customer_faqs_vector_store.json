Before making these changes, you will need to consult either your colleagues or the K3 support team to acquire your encrypted string. The instructions are as follows: Open a File Explorer window. This can be done by pressing the Windows key with the letter E on your keyboard. When the File Explorer window appears, type in C:\\ProgramData\\Merac within the top address bar (highlighted below), and press Enter on your keyboard. Double-click on the MStore(.ini) file (highlighted above).

Please note, the encrypted string in the picture below is for demonstration purposes only. You will need to consult a colleague or K3 support to get your encrypted string. Save the MStore(.ini) file. You can then test your access by logging into the MStore Back Office using the more secure connection. If you receive the below error, please go through this process again to make sure this is correct. If you still cannot resolve this, please speak to K3 support, who will be happy to help.",

If you open and close the cash drawers daily this will be a big sign of stuck transactions. You can also check the that the draw number on the till in the tills screen matches the one in use on the till. Another sign is that if you open the till details and there are zero transactions and figures processed through the till. This is a sign that your till is not sending the transactions to the database or that they are stuck in the SQL table. Incorrect Till and not uploading. Correct till and up to date.",

When sessions are not used, the system uses the calendar to define which days the PLU can be sold and the time slot to define at which times the tickets are available. In the instance where you have a time slot with multiple times, these will be treated as separate time slots available to book and therefore will result in duplication. By updating the time slot (or creating a new one if used elsewhere) to only have a specific time, this will remove duplication: (Ensure you update the web templates, and refresh the webpage)",

There can be any number of reasons for this to occur, including Network errors between the provider and our website Error with the provider PC/Internet browser crashing Power cut Abandoned transactions. Delay in this response being sent to our system. Unfortunately, it is impossible to catch data that we have not received If we do not receive this from your payment provider in 1-2 hours+, this booking will be automatically set to a cancelled reservation, to release the availability for another customer to book.

If you then upload a different image with the same name, this image won't be saved as the original image cannot be overwritten.

    "title": "MStore and ReCaptcha",
    "text": "TABLE OF CONTENTS What is a CAPTCHA? MStore Ticketing and ReCaptcha A Note About Gateways What is a CAPTCHA? A CAPTCHA test is designed to determine if an online user is really a human and not a bot. CAPTCHA is an acronym that stands for \"Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart.\" Users often encounter CAPTCHA and reCAPTCHA tests on the Internet when submitting contact forms, logins and checkouts, to ensure the person submitting the form is a real person. Such tests are one way of managing bot activity, although the approach has its drawbacks. Although CAPTCHAs are designed to block automated bots, CAPTCHAs are themselves automated. They're programmed to pop up in certain places on a website, and they automatically pass or fail users. CAPTCHAs can be user interactive or fully automated. Fully automated/invisible CAPTCHAs use the providers intelligence to determine if the entity browsing a page is real. it bases this on IP address, browser type, and various other HTTP header type of information. This, along with taking a holistic look at a user's behaviour and history of interacting with content on the Internet helps to determine the likelihood of being a bot. Most of the time, the program can decide based on those factors whether or not the user is a bot, without providing the user with a challenge to complete. If not, then the user will get a typical reCAPTCHA challenge. Some examples of a visible CAPTCHA are below. Note: Bots themselves are not necessarily harmful. Google and other search engines use bots to trawl web pages for search purposes. However, not all bots are as pleasant and some are used for nefarious purposes ReCaptcha is a free service offered by Google to allow websites to utilise a CAPTCHA on their own websites, and does require code implementation at the point a site wants to check the authenticity of a user. CAPTCHAs are not foolproof. They are simply one way of helping to reduce the risk of bot attacks. Several hundreds of thousands of pounds can be spent on cybersecurity and bots can still get around it. So it is a rick/reward scenario when considering the use of a CAPTCHA. MStore Ticketing and ReCaptcha We have added support for Google ReCaptcha's Invisible captcha into our core product for new websites, but does require implementation on to existing sites, and will require a conversation with your success manager for this to be enabled. Our ReCaptcha implementation is designed to check the authenticity of the user immediately before forwarding them to the payment gateway. It happens when the user clicks on the Pay Now button. This is designed to reduce the bot traffic to any potential payment gateway. Our implementation allows you to fine tune how \"aggressive\" the ReCaptcha is in deciding if a transaction is a human or bot as shown below. The setting is highlighted below in the website config which you can access on your online portal. Note that the GoogleCaptchaSilentMode allows activity logging to be done without actually having any Captcha process stop/allow transactions. If the CAPTCHA check fails, they do not reach the payment gateway. There will be a visible indicator on this page to tell them it has failed, and it is impossible for a failed CAPTCHA to reach the Gateway. Some human interaction may be interpreted by Google's ReCaptcha due to settings the user has on cookies, using Incognito mode etc A Note About Gateways Payment gateways typically utilise their own threat detection systems, including CAPTCHA systems. If the user is getting a CAPTCHA fail on the Payment Gateway, it is not something we can manage or control.",

    "text": "Historically, when K3 have developed customer ticketing sites to be inline with the customer's general website, we have referenced the customer's own Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) files, hosted on their own servers. This brought benefits such as customers being able to control their stylesheets, which will downstream to our ticketing site... B U T The K3 ticketing site depends on certain CSS content being in a certain format, which means that customers can, inadvertently, break their ticketing site when making changes to their main website. This causes a huge amount of pain for all involved with potential loss of ticketing revenue for K3's customers, and recently these issues have become more frequent. Policy to eliminate ticketing downtime from website styling changes K3 will host a copy of the customer's CSS on our site (as well as customers hosting their own copy on their main website) Impact The ticketing website will not be broken by main website styling changes. Any changes customers want to do to their own website will need to be sent to K3 to be applied to the ticketing site as well This means that, if customers want to make changes to their website styling, you will need to raise a change request through your CSM or Support. We will take a copy of your CSS, apply it, test it, and deploy it with your signoff. This will be a small chargeable consulting project. This policy change will be rolled out as and when required unless you would like to request it's done now. If any of the following apply, this is the point when we will switch from referring to the main website CSS to hosting a copy on the ticketing website: Website Reskin. Mini website reskin where navigation and or simple styling changes are done. Upgrading website technology (to the newer \"bootstrap\" version). This is a simple, proactive solution to prevent ticket purchases being unavailable due to an unexpected change to the main website styling.",

    "title": "How MStore Handles Abandoned Baskets For Online Bookings",
    "text": "This Knowledge Base article will explain how the system deals with online abandoned baskets, to prevent booking/session allocation being held by these bookings, to be available for willing customers. At the time the customer the customer has inserted all their booking details and click Pay Now, all their bookings details gets sent to your MStore database, saved as an online reservation, awaiting confirmation on a successful payment from your online payment provider. However, we have no control once we pass the customer to your online payment provider and may never receive a confirmation from your online payment provider if the customer does not proceed with payment. Therefore, there has to be a set period of time before changing the customers booking to a cancelled reservation. Our system runs a process to cancel any online booking older than an hour (default) without payment confirmation, which can be adjusted. This is run every hour, which can mean bookings may not cancel until between 60-120 minutes after clicking Pay Now. This is a reasonable amount of time to give customers time to pay for their booking (as they may need to find and attempt paying with multiple cards), without receiving payments after the booking has been cancelled, which must be avoided at all costs. This is because this will not resurrect the customers booking, and all seats the customer booked will be available again, potentially making a customer customer believe of having a booking, when they do not. Some payment providers give customers 20 minutes to pay once customers are passed to their portal. So you may have some customisation at the online payment providers end to help with issues relating to this.",

This means the item you are selling does not have a valid price for today, or the day you have chosen to sell this on. Resolution To resolve this issue: Find the item within Price Lookup Index in the MStore Back Office. Open the PLU Maintenance screen for this item (A quick giveaway for the cause can be due to the Current List Price showing as No Valid Price). Click View/Add Price. Within the Price History screen, make sure there is a valid price showing for today, or the date you are trying to sell this item for. We recommend adding 10 years on most PLU's to reduce how common this issue occurs. Do not allow price breaks valid from and to dates to overlap, as this can cause adverse issues Click Apply. Recreate till data (Instructions on this can be found here: How To Recreate Till Data In MStore Back Office), and update the tills affected.

    "text": "In a nutshell, if your MStore version is up to date (not more than 12 months old), you will get the best user experience, and full support. TABLE OF CONTENTS Version Lifecycle Are There any Upgrade Costs? How to Request an Upgrade Version Lifecycle The general version support policy is that customers should be using a release that is less than 12 months old (i.e. it's less than one year after the release date documented in the MStore Release Notes). The benefits of this are: You can take advantage of new features. Have fixes for faults found by our software development and testing team, and by other customers (which you may not experience, or may not know you've experienced). Performance and/or usability may be enhanced. The latest MStore version will be tested on the latest supported versions and service packs of the Windows Operating System (see What Operating Systems is the MStore Back Office Supported On? ) Note that if your server is not not compatible with the above, K3 can host your MStore server in our cloud if you do not want to upgrade your operating system and hardware. Unless in exceptional circumstances, we do not apply patches to existing versions, we fix in the latest version and upgrade you to that version. There are some elements of MStore such as the website, reports or database code/fixes which may be updated separately to fix an issue without an MStore back office and POS upgrade. If your version is older than 12 months, we will only provide support for confirmed P1 and P2 Incidents in the core MStore POS and database/backend software (which may still require an upgrade to fix). All support requests which are not related to a possible fault or superseded functionality in the out of date core software will still be dealt with as normal. Are There any Upgrade Costs? There is no charge for the upgraded software when you have a current subscription (except chargeable modules which you have not previously purchased). Effort required from K3 to do an upgrade The effort required to upgrade your system to fix significant faults you have experienced is free of charge as long as it's during normal business hours (9-5:30 weekdays excluding public holidays). Your subscription also entitles you to one free functional upgrade per year during normal business hours (e.g. if you want to take advantage of new features and/or make sure that your version is no more than 12 months old). The time spent installing an upgrade is chargeable if it's required to be done out of normal business hours (agreed upon request), or if more than one functional upgrade is requested in a year. An upgrade typically takes 1-2 hours, but varies according to complexity and size of you system architecture. How to Request an Upgrade If you're not sure what version you have, please see How to check what version of MStore you are using. Please raise a service request on the support portal as shown in the example below. The upgrade steps can be found in MStore Core System Upgrade Process which describes what customers and K3 need to do.",

    "title": "MStore Core System Upgrade Process",
    "text": "The general upgrade policy and lifecycle for MStore can be found on What versions of MStore are supported? including what triggers an upgrade to be done. The \"MStore Core System\" refers to the MStore database, Back Office, and Till/POS programs. Overview We will schedule a day and time with you to do the upgrade which needs to be when you do not need to use the POS/tills. If there is not already a support ticket for this, we will raise one to capture all communications regarding the upgrade. The upgrade is done on the MStore database server first, and then all tills and PCs pull down the update when they are restarted. If there are any tills online, we will connect onto a couple to make sure that the new version has been installed correctly. We will then let you check and confirm that the others have been updated successfully. Server Upgrade The database server upgrade is done first, and is carried out by K3 who will: Log onto your database server using Team Viewer. Take a backup of your database. Running a database upgrade script (which, as applicable, will add and change stored procedures, amend or add additional tables and fields as needed. Copy across new files to be \"blobbed\" into the database and authorised via MStore to send to tills and computers running our software. Recreate the till data file, so the latest data and files are sent to all the tills when they restart. Back Office and Till Upgrade How to Trigger the Upgrade Once the server upgrade is complete, the upgrade on all tills and machines running the MStore Back Office can be triggered in any of the following ways: Restart the machine (preferred/safest method). Note that tablets will need to be powered off and on again (usually by pressing and holding the power button - just a single press puts the table into standby mode and does not restart it) Restart the Windows Service \"MeracUpdater\" For tills, you can click on this button Technical Details There is a windows service called \"MeracUpdater\" that runs on start-up. This detects if there is a newer version and if so applies this to the computer. The update normally takes 20-30 seconds and will likely already happened by the time a computer boots up and is ready to use. There is no reason to keep computers on to receive the update. Leaving one or two tills allow us to make sure those specific tills do update when we try the above. There are 3 things that could prevent the update. During the original installation of the MStore software, full permissions will have been set over the path \"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Merac\" for all users. If this isn’t set then it will prevent the software being overwritten with newer files. The MStore software has been left open. You can’t overwrite a file if it is open. Computers being restarted prevents this. The computer is running the wrong version of the updater process (unlikely). If any computers fail to update, we recommend a reboot. If the update has still not been downloaded, please let K3 Support know, as they will need to dial into the affected computer and check the setup and fix. Rollback In the rare circumstances when an upgrade does not work as expected, the rollback process is very dependent on the situation, but the general process is as follows: K3 will investigate the cause to find out if it's setup/data-related, giving a workaround if possible. In agreement with you, we would generally allow a maximum of 1 hour before moving to the next step if the issue is preventing trading. K3 to reinstall the previous version of the software as a temporary measure via the same process above, where we deem this to be a program issue. Therefore restarting tills/PCs will pull down the desired version. K3 will use the previous database backup to refer back to and help investigate issues that had occurred between your previous version and the latest version. Once the rollback is complete, we would work as top priority to find the cause of the issue and provide a fix.",

    "title": "Tips to keep your self-hosted MStore database performing at its best",
    "text": "K3 hosts many customers' databases, but if you host your own database, here are some tips on databases maintenance best practices which will help to make sure that you don't experience performance issues (e.g. slow reports) caused by a lack of database maintenance. MStore uses Microsoft SQL Server for it’s database which is a transactional database with a lot of data is written to it and updated on it. To prevent issues when retrieving data it is very important to keep the database healthy using a scheduled maintenance plan in SQL server. The following points are advised to address this: Perform data integrity checks Regularly checking the consistency of your databases helps ensure data integrity. SQL Server provides commands such as DBCC CHECKDB to detect and repair integrity issues in the database. Maintain indexes Indexes are crucial for query performance. Over time, indexes can become fragmented, leading to decreased performance. SQL Server provides maintenance tasks such as rebuilding or reorganizing indexes to optimize their performance. Regular index maintenance should be scheduled to keep your database running efficiently. Update statistics SQL Server uses statistics to generate optimal query execution plans. Outdated or inaccurate statistics can lead to suboptimal query performance. SQL Server automatically updates statistics, but in some cases, manual updates may be necessary, especially on large tables or after significant data changes. Monitor disk space and clean up data Monitoring disk space is critical to prevent data loss and maintain database performance. Regularly check disk space usage on the server hosting your SQL Server databases and ensure that you have adequate space for backup files, transaction logs and database growth. Implement data archiving and cleanup processes to remove obsolete or unnecessary data from databases. Restrict Memory Usage You might want to limit the amount of memory which SQL Server uses on a machine because if it's allowed to use all memory, this can have adverse effects. Back up databases and transaction logs It’s important to take regular backups and test them periodically. Be sure to follow retention policies for backup files. Is your Database on a Fit-For-Purpose Server? If the above tips do not solve the issue, please check if your server is up to date enough (i.e .not more than 5 years old), and is it hosting anything else? Is your server running one of the supported versions of Windows - see What Operating Systems is the MStore Back Office Supported On? Do you need help with this? If this all seems too technical and you need help, we can host your database for you, but we can also remotely manage your database running on your own server. For more information on hosting, please contact your customer success manager. For more information on K3 helping you manage your database, please see the options in K3 MStore Database Optimisation and Maintenance Plan.",

    "title": "K3 MStore Database Optimisation and Maintenance Plan",
    "text": "TABLE OF CONTENTS What is Database Optimisation? Why Optimise Your K3 Application Database? Who Is Responsible? How Can K3 Help? K3’s Experts Steps to an Optimised Database Additional Options Database Backups Disaster Recovery Testing Archiving Next Steps What is Database Optimisation? Database optimisation is the process of using various database manufacturer tools to fine tune their efficiency and maximise the speed at which it works. The tools need configuring, monitoring, and the results evaluated to achieve this. Why Optimise Your K3 Application Database? In a dynamic business landscape, ensuring fast and reliable application responses from your database infrastructure is paramount. K3 applications have a database to store information such as transactions, customer records, configuration and much more. If you have a database which is not performing very well, you may find that responses in the application are slow, or even time-out, preventing you from running your business effectively. This is easily avoided if you have the right technical procedures in place to ensure this doesn’t happen. Who Is Responsible? K3 offer a cloud hosted database service, but if you are hosting the database on your own infrastructure, then your IT team are responsible for its maintenance. We provide guidance for some products on how your IT Team can keep the database in the best condition (see this article for logged-in users), but if your team does not include database experts, then for a minimal cost we can help you avoid costly issues with availability and performance of your database. How Can K3 Help? K3’s Experts We have product and databases experts ready to provide assurance that your database is performing the best it can on your server. These experts already manage our cloud database hosting service for customers, and so have the product and database technical experience to know what’s best for your application database. Importantly, they know how to tune, but then also maintain that state of tune as your database grows and changes over time. Steps to an Optimised Database The fixed price Database Optimisation and Maintenance Plan consist of the stages below. Initialisation Perform diagnostic checks on the database and run tools to optimise it We will also recommend any changes you might need to make on your server (e.g. if it does not have enough space or memory). Validate your Backup Regime Meet Requirements K3 are not responsible for your database backups, but we can make sure it is being backed up to the local server for your own tools to copy off the server, and advise if you need to implement anything additional. Configure and schedule a regular maintenance plan The optimisation tasks will run weekly outside of the hours your business is open. Monitoring and Verification Alerts will be configured from your database to email K3 Support directly If there are issues reported by the database, Support will act upon those tickets from the email quickly which will be raised as a Priority 2 by default. Monthly Inspection Once a month, we will log on to your server and inspect it manually to make sure all optimisation routines are as expected, and that they are having an effect. You will be provided with a brief report giving you the assurance that everything is OK. Annual Health Check At the beginning of each subsequent year since the plan commenced, the same diagnostic steps will be performed as the Initialisation phase which includes recommendations which might have changed due to any changes on the server (some servers host more than the K3 product database, so there are many variables). What Happens if there’s a Problem? The Database Optimisation and Maintenance Plan is provided on a fixed price basis per database. If any of the checks find an issue that we need to spend time investigating and resolving, then we will do this on a time and materials basis at the applicable standard rate. An example of this work would be if the database has grown too large and you would like us to archive some data. Additional Options The following can optionally be added to the Database Optimisation and Maintenance Plan Database Backups Ensuring your data is backed up in the case of a major incident is essential in any business continuity plan. We will give you the comfort of knowing that backups are being created successfully (at a schedule you define - e.g. every night) which will include making sure that they are the expected size, location, and number of old versions kept. Frequency: Checking backups would be part of the monthly Monitoring and Verification stage described previously. Disaster Recovery Testing If you have subscribed to the optional extra of verifying that database backups are being created, you can also add on that we will do a Disaster Recovery test. This takes your assurance that you are ready for anything to the next level by taking your most recent backup, connecting it to the K3 back office and till programs, and ensuring the integrity of the database backup. Frequency: This can be done as often as required by the customer – we would recommend at least every 6 months. Archiving If you would like to regularly archive your data, we can add this to the Database Optimisation and Maintenance Plan. Sometimes a database can grow so large that it impacts performance, even if all the other industry standard maintenance actions are taking place. Data that can be archived includes dormant customers, and transactions older than a certain number of years. The archived data is kept in a separate database for you to backup and keep. Frequency: This can be done as often as required by the customer. We would perform analysis on the database first and provide a recommendation. Next Steps Contact your K3 Customer Success Manager to discuss what best fits your needs, and how we can work together to give you optimum performance and business continuity. Download our brochure if you would like to discuss this with your team.",

When I go to the button configuration on the till and try to create the promotion button. In the drop down “promotion scheme” dropdown there are no promotions listed. Can you advise how I associate a scheme with a button? A) - Promotion set to everyone, changed to selected and now can add to a button. There are no products added to this promotion at the moment so this needs to be done before it can be active.",

    "text": "Inability to change a session booking time when not changing the date. Unable to move the booking to a different time on the same day. e.g. Our Father Christmas train have multiple sessions on one day. If we want to move a booking from one DAY to another DAY then the 'Move booking' button works fine. But if we want to change the time but not the date of the booking this function does not work. The change seats button only works within one session, so this is no use either. How do we move seats from one session to another on the same date? Solution There is no button to move a (session) booking time. First find and open the booking and take screenshots of the current booking / allocated seats etc as is so you have a record of it to go back to (in case they need to refer to how it was). Then would need to first add the tickets for the relevant session for the new time at the required quantities to the existing booking (ensuring you check the prices of the new tickets added) and re-allocate the seats. Caveat, this will only be allowed if there are the tickets / seats available for the new time. Check these additions are correct, then I would save the changes at that point. They would then remove the tickets at the times they did not want - I believe it would be best to de-allocate seats before removing the tickets to ensure the seats are put back into availability in case just removing the tickets does not de-allocate the seats (old versions had issues with releasing seat availability this way it should negate that). Then check the booking looks as required and save the changes.",

Confirmation from a customer below; I can now confirm that it was the date format. On the other till I changed the date format only and promotions started working. I suspect PMStore grabs the local date as a string and uses it to compare with the start/end date. As the format was different than expected, the date fell out of range which made the promotion invalid.

    "title": "Member Mailing",
    "text": "TABLE OF CONTENTS Introduction Using Member Mailing Introduction The following is a step by step example on how to use the ‘Member Mailing’ option within the ‘K3|mstore’ back office software. This option enables you to create your own data extracts from your member’s database which you can either (i) extract as a Microsoft Excel spread sheet, or (ii) mail merge to Microsoft Word. Using both functions requires you to have Microsoft Word and Excel already installed on your computer by your IT department. Please note that K3 Business Technologies (K3 BTG) can only support any problems experienced during the creation of the data extract in the ‘K3|mstore’. Once the data has been extracted into a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet, or merged into Microsoft Word, then any technical support or training for these applications is not provided by K3 BTG. Using Member Mailing The following instructions detail how to use member mailing to extract data. First, click on the ‘Members’ button. Next, select the ‘Mailing’ option. Select ‘Mail_Membership’ from the dropdown list. Now click on ‘Accept’. You will see the screen as shown below. We will now show you one specific example of how to extract member data, for memberships will expire between a selected date range. Select ‘Membership expiry date’ from the ‘Database Field’ dropdown as shown below. Now select 'Is between the values' from the ‘Comparison’ dropdown as shown below. Now select the required “from” date from the top ‘Value’ dropdown as shown below. Now select the required “to” date from the bottom ‘Value’ dropdown as shown below. Next click on the 'Accept' button. N.B. in this example we are only carrying out a simple search. If you wanted to add multiple ‘Search Criteria’ you could select other criteria from the ‘Database Field’ dropdown list here and add these additional criteria as required (using a similar procedure as detailed above). Once all the search criteria have been defined as required, click on ‘Extract’. If you want the results as a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet, click on 'Export Data To List'. The Microsoft Excel spreadsheet will be created automatically. Now click on the ‘Microsoft Excel’ icon on your Windows ‘Taskbar’ . This will open this spreadsheet so you can view and use this data as required. Alternatively, the results can be merged to a Microsoft Word mail merge template. First ensure you have selected the required Microsoft Word mail merge template. To do this click here to navigate to the required Microsoft Word mail merge template. Navigate to the required folder and click on the required Microsoft Word mail merge template. Next click on ‘Open’. Now click on the ‘Mail Merge’ to Word button. The mail merge will be created automatically. Click the ‘Microsoft Word’ icon on your Windows ‘taskbar’ to view the mail merge results. As explained previously K3 BTG do not provide support or training on Microsoft Word, but we have included some simple notes below on using the mail merge facilities in Microsoft Word. If the screens appear different when using mail merges on your version of Word, then please speak to your preferred IT training provider for advice. Please note that there is an issue with most versions of Microsoft Word when using mail merges whereby the toolbars at the top of the screen will not work unless you first minimise then maximise this window. Please minimise then maximise this window before proceeding. Once you have done this, click on the ‘Preview Results’ icon. This will show you what the merge results would look like if completed. Next click on ‘Finish and Merge’ to proceed with the mail merge. There are now three options that can be selected as shown here. These are detailed below. The options available in this dropdown menu are shown below. Each of these options is explained on the following pages. (1) ‘Edit Individual Documents’ Under the ‘Merge records’ section, select which record(s) you want to include: Select ‘All’ to edit all records. There are now three options that can be selected, which are detailed below. To edit only the record displayed select ‘Current record’. To edit only certain records, type a range in the text boxes. Next click on ‘OK’ to merge the required records into a Microsoft Word document. (2) ‘Print Documents’ Under the ‘Merge records’ section, select which record(s) you want to include: Select ‘All’ to print all records. To print only the record displayed select ‘Current record’. To print only certain records, type a range in the text boxes. Now click ‘OK’, which takes you to the printer selection screen. Now select the required printer. Click ‘OK’ to print all the merged letters. (3) ‘Send Email Messages’ In the ‘Subject line:’ text box, type a subject. From the ‘Mail format’ dropdown list, select the desired format for your message. Under the ‘Send records’ section, select which record(s) you want to include: Select ‘All’ to send email to all of your records. To send email for only the record displayed select ‘Current record’. To send email to only certain records, type a range in the text boxes. Caution: if you now click on ‘OK’ the email messages will be sent to your recipient(s).",

Setting to 10 on the bookable resource will limit how many tickets are available PER BOOKING, but this will not stop people from just making another booking.

Generally this will be per day, but it is possible to have more than one time slot per day. Sold 6, refreshing the page: Once availability for the day is gone, the day will go red and no longer be bookable. Birthday Parties: Requires specialized set up.

This will be because your integration has Allow deactivating of inactive products ticked. This means that any item in Shopify that is not ticked as a Shopify Item in the PLU Maintenance within the MStore Back Office (see screenshot below) or the item is not derived from MStore will be set to Draft. If you would like Allow deactivating of inactive products setting changed, please contact support via the portal to get this changed for you. However, this will mean you will need to manually set PLU's that were previously set as a Shopify Item in the MStore Back Office but now this has been unticked, to Draft.",

    "title": "PEDInESDRecoveryMode When Taking Card Payment On MStore Till",
    "text": "If you are using the VeriFone Ocius Sentinel integration with our MStore till, and you receive the PEDInESDRecoveryMode message on the till during a card payment, this is due to the card machine having a feature that detects static and will shut the card machine down to protect itself. This can be caused due to the card machine being in damp environments, on metal surfaces and/or close to other electronic devices, like detaggers and hearing loops. The short-term fix for this would be to unplug the card machine ONLY from the power source, wait 10 seconds, and then plugging it back in. Once you have done this, restart the till, where card payments should begin working again once the till has logged back in again. If this does not resolve the issue please do get in contact with our support team to help further with this. Long-term prevention steps that can be taken by avoiding damp environments, metal surfaces and other electronic devices touching or being close to the card machine. You can also use anti-static clothes to wipe down surfaces in contact with the card machine, or cleaning cards for card machines can remove static.",

    "text": "If you begin having an issue when trying to take a card payment on your till, where the till is no longer able to communicate to its respective card machine, we advise your first port of call to log the till off to the 4/5-button program, power the card machine off (by unplugging any power cables or mains plug for the card machine, making sure the display turns off, Do not touch the power for any other device) and then power the card machine back on again. Once the card machine is on a static screen (e.g. \"Waiting On Merchant Login\" for VeriFone P400), you may then log back into the till program and try taking another card payment. Once the card machine is logged in without any payments being processed at the time, it should say \"Ready\".",
