    "title": "Configuring MStore Till Buttons",
    "text": "TABLE OF CONTENTS Introduction Overview Amending a Till Button Button Configuration Screen Assigning a PLU to a Till Button Amending Text / Colour Properties of a Button Adding Image Files to a Button Copying, Pasting, Clearing and Hiding Buttons Changing the Sizes of Buttons Changing Sales Panel Text Properties Changing Sales Panel Names Introduction In the ‘K3|mstore’ back office software you can configure your ePoS till screens to be as required to meet the needs of your business, whether this is for admissions, hospitality or retail requirements. Till buttons can be used for a wide range of tasks but the focus of this user guide is to show you how to assign an item that you sell (know as a PLU) to a till button Overview Firstly, in order to make any changes to till buttons you must have the keyboard and mouse attached. In order to edit a button, first click on the relevant ‘Sales Panel’ to bring up the buttons in this panel. In this instance we will be using the ‘Admission Tickets’ panel located here, so we clicked on this ‘Sales Panel’. When you click on a ‘Sales Panel’ the buttons within that panel are then shown here. How to amend the button contents and properties are explained in the following sections. Amending a Till Button To change a button on this 'Sales Panel' first position the mouse cursor over any of the buttons in this 'Sales Panel'. to Now hold down the CTRL key on your computer keyboard (usually located in the bottom left corner of our keyboard). While holding this button down, next right click once on your mouse, then release the CTRL key. If done correctly a new screen will then appear like the one shown below, this is the ‘Button Panel Configuration’ screen. In order to changes the PLU assigned to the required button, you must right click on the button itself. For example to add a new PLU sales button tot he right on the 'Adult Day Ticket' right click on this spare button. A pop up menu will then be shown like the one below, with various options. Next left click on the ‘Configure Button’ option. This will open the ‘Button Configuration’ screen, that is explained in the following section. Button Configuration Screen An example ‘Button Configuration’ configuration screen is shown below. The contents of the above screen are explained in the table below: Button Text Enter the required description for this button. here Text Align: Use this option to select the required text alignment for this button. Font: Use this option to select the required font for this button. Font Size: Use this option to select the required font size for the text on that button. There are also tick box options to make the text bold, italic, or underlined as required. Enable: You can activate or de-activate the button using this tick-box. Visible: You can either hide or show this button on the till screen using this tick-box. Back Colour: You can pick the button’s background colour by left-clicking this button Font Colour: You can pick the button’s font colour by left-clicking this button Picture File: You can assign a JPEG image file to assign to a till button using this option. When using images, you will need to manually resize each image to fit the button size. Please Note: using image files on a till can slow down using the till screens. For this reason it is a requirement to shut down the till every night when using images on buttons. Picture Align: Select the required alignment for the image on the button using this drop-down. The various Button Actions shown in the above screen are also explained in the below table: None: This is selected if you are not using the button. Text Only: This is generally used for keyboard commands i.e. backspace like a hot key. Sell Item: This is for your items that you want to sell a single item (PLU) by pressing this button. Switch Panel: This is to jump to another panel (which we is covered in panel configuration). Command: This is for commands e.g. the ‘Find Product’, or ‘New Member Wizard’ functionality buttons. Voucher: If ‘Vouchers’ have been set-up, this is used to assign a button to a ‘Voucher’ denomination. Promotion: If ‘Selected’ (coupon driven) promotions have been set-up, this is for assigning a button to a ‘Coupon’. Wastage: This is used for setting up a entering a button that can waste a specific stock item and quantity at the PoS (typically the 'Write-Off Next Item' command functionality is used to enter wastage at the PoS) Assigning a PLU to a Till Button In this example we will assume we are putting a single item (PLU) that we want to sell onto a blank button. If so, the ‘Button Configuration’ screen will look like the one below. In order to sell an item on a button, you must first select the ‘Sell Item’ option by clicking the where shown. You will now see the screen has changed as shown below, to enable you to select the PLU to assign to the button. Next click on the binoculars button, to the right of the ‘Sell Item’ box. Enter a ‘Code’ or ‘Description’ of the PLU you want to find and click ‘Search’. You can use the ↑↓ keys on your keyboard to scroll up/down the list. Once the required PLU is highlighted, click ‘Ok’. Alternatively, click on the required PLU and it will be selected automatically. You will now see the selected PLU code appears in the ‘Sell Item’ box. Amending Text / Colour Properties of a Button You can now amend the text on the button using the ‘Text Properties’ section of this screen. Enter the required description for this button in the ‘Button Text’ box. N.B. this defaults to the PLU description. Amend the text in the 'Button Text' field as required. As you to the text the changes will appear on the example button, in the top right corner of the screen. Use the ‘Text Align’ drop-down to select the required alignment for the button text. Select the required font using the ‘Font’ drop-down (the default font is ‘Arial’). Select the required font size using the ‘Font Size’ drop-down. Select whether the font will be ‘Bold’, ‘Italic’ or ‘Underline’ by ticking the relevant boxes. Click the box to the right of ‘Back Colour’ to select the required background colour, using the colour selector screen. Click the box to the right of ‘Font Colour’ to select the required font colour,, using the colour selector screen. The colour selector screen that appears in both case will be as shown below. Simply click on the required button colour from the ‘Basic Colours’ grid. Alternatively, clicking ‘Define Custom Colours’ allows you to select / define your own color as required. Click ‘Ok’ once the required colour has been selected. You will now be back at the following screen. To confirm the changes, click the ‘OK’ button. Next, click the ‘Apply’ and then ‘Ok’ buttons in that order. This takes you back to the main till screen. The new button should now be showing on the relevant till screen. We recommend you click on the button to test that it sells the PLU correctly. N.B. as with any changes to till screen you must now send them to the till(s) using Edit > Recreate Till Data as usual. Adding Image Files to a Button There is the option to add a picture to this button, however there are some caveats: (1) Adding images to till buttons can slow down the operation of the till, especially opening screens with pictures. (2) When using images on till button you will need to shut down the till regularly (we recommend each night) (3) The software does not scale images to fit buttons, you must resize all the images yourself to fit each button. (4) Only a .JPG image file can be assigned to a till button. For the above reasons we advise caution when assigning images to buttons and do not recommend it, unless you feel it is absolutely necessary to put an image file on a till button(s). To assign an image file to a button, click on the binoculars to the right of the ‘Picture File’ box. Navigate to where your JPG images are stored and click on the required image. Now click ‘Open’. N.B. if you select the wrong image, or wish to remove the image from the button, then simply click on the ‘X’ button to the right of the ‘Picture File’ box to remove the image. You can select how you want the picture file to be aligned on the button using the ‘Picture Align’ drop-down. Please note any ‘Button Text’ will still be present when you assign an image to a button. If the ‘Button Text’ cannot easily be read once the image is on the button, you can remove the ‘Button Text’. Alternatively, you may want to amend the change e.g. the ‘Font Colour’ so the text stands out. Click ‘Ok’ once you have assigned the picture and centred it to be as required. Click the ‘Apply’ and then ‘Ok’ buttons to confirm the button changes. You will now be on the till screen, so check the button appears and functions as required. If the size of the image does not fit the button, you will need to resize the JPG image and re-attach it as above. N.B. as before any changes to till screen you must send them to the till(s) using Edit > Recreate Till Data. Copying, Pasting, Clearing and Hiding Buttons To copy, paste, clear or hide buttons, you need to be in the ‘Button Panel Configuration’ screen. As before this is done by hovering the mouse over the panel you want to edit, then hold down the CTRL key. Then single click the right-hand mouse button (and you can then release the CTRL key). A pop-up menu options shown below will then appear as shown below: The ‘Copy Button’ and ‘Paste Button’ options are useful when you want to move buttons. For example, you may need to move buttons to make space around them before you expand their width or height. To copy an entire button (i.e. the PLU and the button text, font, colour etc), left click the ‘Copy Button’ option. You can then paste this button to where you want it to go. To do this right mouse click the button you want to paste to (usually a free button) and from the options that pop-up, left click the ‘Paste Button’ option. Please note this will note the button that you copied will still be present, so you may want to clear this button. To do this right-mouse click on the button and from the options that pop-up, left click the ‘Clear Button’ option. There are also ‘Copy Attributes’ and ‘Paste Attributes’ options. These are used just like the above options, but these options are used to copy and paste the “style” only of a button to another button (colours, font etc). Sometimes you may want to set up a button in advance but not want it to be seen on your till until later. To do this right-mouse click on the button and from the options that pop-up, left click the ‘Hide Button’ option. A hidden button looks like the one shown below, as a flat button (usually the button appears to be raised) At the point you want to show this button then right-mouse click it and form the options select ‘Un-Hide Button’. Please note if you mark a button as ‘Hidden’ then if you went into the ‘Button Configuration’ for this button, you will notice it has simply removed the tick in the ‘Visible’ tick box. So, this is the alternative way of hiding / unhiding a button by ticking / unticking the above box as required. If required you can also disable a button, to do this untick the ‘Enable’ tick-box where shown. Click ‘Ok’ to confirm any changes that were made. As usual, click ‘Apply’ and ‘Ok’ to confirm the button changes made. N.B. as with any changes to till screen you must send them to the till(s) using Edit > Recreate Till Data. The difference between how a disabled and hidden button appears on the till is shown below. To set the buttons back to an ‘Enabled’ / ‘Visible’ button again simply access the ‘Button Configuration’ screen (as detailed previously and tick the required box(es) so they are back to normal. Click ‘Ok’ to confirm any changes that were made. As with any change, click ‘Apply’ and ‘Ok’ to confirm the changes made. To do this send the changes to the till(s) in the usual way, by clicking Edit > Recreate Till Data. Changing the Sizes of Buttons In the ‘Button Panel Configuration’ screen the size of the buttons can also be amended. Please note the width of a button can only be expanded to the right and the height of a button can only be expanded downwards, so before doing this process make sure there is the required space around the specific button(s). To widen a button, right mouse click on it and left mouse click on the ‘Expand Width Right’ option. To increase the height of a button, right mouse click on it and left mouse click the ‘Expand Height Down’ option. If you want to decrease the width or height of a button you made larger, then you simply right mouse click the button and select the ‘Shrink Width’ and/or the ‘Shrink Height’ option(s) as required. Please note that if you expand a button without moving the button next to / below it, the expanded button will simply go over the top of the existing button. Please note if you do this in error, simply shrink the button back to its original size and the button that was covered will still be there. As before you must click ‘Apply’ and ‘Ok’ to confirm the button changes made and as usual you must. Next, send these changes to the required till(s) using Edit > Recreate Till Data. Changing Sales Panel Text Properties Please note, if required you can easily change the text / colour of each of the buttons that opens a ‘Sales Panel’ As before, in order to make any changes to till buttons you must have the keyboard and mouse attached. In order to amend the name, you first need to hover the mouse pointer over this specific section of the screen. So, in this case the mouse pointer would need to be located over the right hand column of buttons as indicated below. Now hold down the CTRL key on your keyboard (usually near the bottom left corner of the keyboard). While holding this button down, next single right-click on your mouse (and then you can release the CTRL key) As before the ‘Button Panel Configuration’ screen appears, but you can see it is for the selected section of the till screen. Now right-click on the button you want to amend the text / colour of with your mouse. Changing Sales Panel Names You now left click the ‘Configure Button’ option form the below list. As before, it is now just a case of changing the text, font, font size and colours etc of this button to be as required. Click ‘Ok’ once the required changes have been made. You will now be back at the ‘Button Panel Configuration’ screen. As before you must click ‘Apply’ and ‘Ok’ to confirm the button changes made. As usual you must then send these changes to the required till(s) using Edit > Recreate Till Data.",

    "title": "Cashing Up POS Tills in Back Office",
    "text": "TABLE OF CONTENTS Introduction Cashing Up Variances between Z-Read and Cashup Amounts Cashing Up Reconciliation Report Introduction This article explains how to ‘Cashup’ using the K3|mstore back office software. This process requires you to enter the actual takings you counted, then the difference between these figures you entered and the till's expected figures (the ‘Z Read’) is calculated. This calculated difference is known as the “Variance”. Although this process is not mandatory, it would be required if you want to have and audit trail of these figures in the K3|mstore software, and for the related reports for cashing up and variance tracking to be used. Cashing Up Login to the ‘K3|mstore’ back office software and click on the ‘Tills’ main menu button. Select the required date that you wish to cash up the till on using the date selector. Double click on the cash drawer you want to cash up. Please note you can only cash-up a cash drawer that is closed, i.e. the ‘Z read’ has been done at the till for that cash drawer. The column will show in a red colour for any cash drawer that is closed, i.e. a 'Z read' has been done at the till. You will see the screen as shown below. Next click the ‘Cash Up’ Button You will see the screen as shown below - click the ‘Yes’ button. You will now see the following screen. Figures from the ‘Z-read’ and any 'Variances' will automatically appear in the relevant (middle and right hand) columns. Now enter the actual amounts counted for each payment method in the left hand section called 'Money in Cash Drawer'. There are 2 columns to allow for the entry of quantity and value for payments methods. This is because variance on both quantity and value is required, calculated and is reported on. For any payment method where a quantity is also required, enter this information as well. Please note when entering the 'Cash in Till:' amount this can be entered in the relevant box, just by typing in the required value for the cash counted (which would include any float amount if the float was entered on the MStore PoS when opening this cash drawer). Alternatively if the 'Calc' button is clicked then below screen will appear, to enable you to enter the quantity of each denomination of note and the total value of coinage counted. Once all the required data has been entered, on clicking 'Ok' the total cash value entered will populate the ''Cash in Till:' field on the 'Cashing Up' screen. Once the required data has been entered, click the ‘Cash Up’ button again (at the bottom of the screen). At the following screen click the ‘Yes’ button. Variances between Z-Read and Cashup Amounts Any variance between the ‘Z read’ and amounts you just entered will now show in the 'Variances' column. If there is any variance at all (positive or negative) you must enter a reason for this variance. To do this simply click in the 'Reason' field and type the required reason for the variance reported, e.g. \"Counting error\". Once any variance reason has been entered or if there is no variance, then has been done, or there is no variance then click the ‘Finalise’ button. Click the ‘Yes’ button at the screen shown below. Cashing Up Reconciliation Report You will now get an option to print the cashing up reconciliation report, click ‘Yes’ or ‘No’ as required. If you click ‘Yes’, then you see the following screen. The 'Report Parameters' default to the correct till and date and time, so these should not need to be changed. If you wish to print a hard copy of the report: Select the required printer from the ‘Printer’ drop-down list (where indicated above). Select the required number of copies from the ‘Copies’ drop-down list to be as required. Click the ‘Print’ button (bottom right corner of the screen). Click the ‘Cancel’ button to exit the report screen. If you wish to view a copy of the report on screen: Click the ‘Screen’ button (bottom right corner of the screen). Click the ‘Close’ button to exit the report. Click the ‘Cancel’ button to exit the report screen. Alternatively, if you do not want to print or view the ‘Reconciliation Report’ click ‘No’. You will be back at the following screen, click ‘Close’. You have now finished the cashing up procedure.",

    "title": "New Stock Wizard",
    "text": "TABLE OF CONTENTS Introduction Simple “1:1” Stock Item Creation Introduction This manual shows you how to set up a stock item in the simplest way possible, using the ‘New Stock Wizard’. The type of stock item that is set up in this manual is referred to as a “1:1” stock item. This means you deliver the stock item in single units and sell it as single units, hence “1:1” stock. The example that is followed in this manual is setting up a ‘Cola Can’, but the same logic would apply for a wide variety of stock items, e.g. bottled drinks, crisps, confectionary bars, guide books, pens etc. Simple “1:1” Stock Item Creation In this example we will set up a stock item in the simplest way possible. This is what we refer to as a “1:1” stock item. This means you deliver the stock item in single units and sell it as single units, hence “1:1” stock. So if we were to take a theoretical example of a Cola Can. The easiest way to set up the “finished product” stock item is by using the ‘New Stock Wizard’. This can be located by clicking 1. Setup then 2. clicking Stock then 3. double clicking New Stock Wizard. Select ‘Stocked Item’ by clicking on it, then click on the ‘Next’ button Select the required ‘Item Group’ from the drop-down selector. (N.B. you can add new ‘Item Groups’ by clicking on the ‘Item Groups’ button) Enter the required description for the stock item (i.e. as this is “1:1” stock the description refers to the can). Leave the ‘Stock Unit’ as ‘Each’ (for 1:1 stock it is recommended to keep all stock units as ‘Each’). Enter the ‘Pack Size’ as required, e.g. 24 (i.e. the number of cans per cans per pack). Select the ‘Valuation Group’ (if required) from the relevant drop-down box. The other fields of ‘Sales Suffix’, ‘Weight’, ‘Size’ and ‘Bin Location’ are only entered if required. Click on the ‘Next’ button once all the required information is entered. If required enter the ‘Re-Order Level’, ‘Re-order Qty’ and ‘Maximum Qty’ (in single units, not packs). Enter the cost of a single item in the ‘Standard Cost’ (i.e. the cost of one can, not the pack cost). Click in the ‘Latest Cost’ box and the cost will automatically populate this and ‘Ave Cost’ boxes for you. Click on the ‘Next’ button once all the required information is entered. Select the ‘Main Supplier’ from the drop-down list. Enter the ‘Main Supplier’s Code’ for this item (i.e. the supplier’s own code for this item if applicable). You do not need to add an ‘Alternate Supplier’, however if required: Select the ‘Alternate Supplier’ from the drop-down list. Enter the ‘Alternate Supplier’s Code’ for this item (i.e. the supplier’s own code for this item if applicable). N.B. you can add a new supplier using the ‘Suppliers’ button. Click on the ‘Next’ button once all the required information is entered. For “1:1” stock items setup you must leave the ‘I want to sell this item’ box here ticked. Amend the ‘Short Description’ as required, then click in the ‘Long Description’ box and do the same. Select the ‘Pricing Type’. Select the required ‘Analysis Code’ and ‘VAT Code’ by using the relevant drop-down box. Enter the required selling price for this item in the ‘Sell Price (Inc VAT)’ box. Select the ‘Price Valid From:’ and ‘Price Valid To:’ as required. Enter the ‘Nominal Code’ (if required). Once all the required information is selected, click on the ‘Next’ button to proceed. N.B. this screen is only required for food items that have any order option / kitchen printing requirements. Simply click ‘Next’ if this screen is not required (which is likely to be the case for most stock items). On the following screen you will be required to enter a ‘Code / Barcode’. There are two main options relating to entering the barcode of the item in the below screen. Option 1 If your items have a manufacturer’s barcode on them (e.g. a Cola Can) and you want to scan these items on the till to sell them, then type in the manufacturer’s barcode in the ‘Code / Barcode’ box. Alternatively, if you are using ‘MStore’ on a till or computer that has a compatible* scanner attached, then you can scan the item’s barcode at this point, and it will appear in the ‘Code / Barcode’ box. * Please note: a “compatible scanner” is one that has been supplied and installed by K3. If you have purchased a scanner yourself then this may not be configured correctly and any issues with configuring or using this device are not be supported by K3. Option 2 If you are not using scanners to sell items on your tills, this means that you will have to press a button on the till to sell this item. In this instance the choices when it comes to the ‘Code/Barcode’ are given below: (i) If the item has a manufacturer’s barcode on it, enter the manufacturer’s barcode. The advantage is that if you install scanners in the future the correct barcodes are already present. (ii) For items that do not have a manufacturer’s barcodes on them, simply make up your own coding system and enter your code in the ‘Code/Barcode’ box. N.B. when making up your own codes for items we recommend using an alpha-numeric coding system. This ensures you do not accidentally create your own codes that clash with manufacturer’s barcodes. We also recommend that you do not use punctuation marks or spaces in the ‘Code / Barcode’ box. Most customers who make their own codes for items use a prefix of letters, followed by a sequential number. Please note each item must have a unique code, For “1:1” stock we recommend leaving the ‘Sell Unit’ as ‘Each’. For “1:1” stock you must leave the ‘Conv Factor to Stock Unit’ as shown above (i.e. “1 / 1 = 1”). Next click on the ‘Add’ button. You will see the code, unit and price highlighted yellow. If required at this point you can add this item into stock for a specific location, to do this: Select required ‘Stock Location’ from the drop-down list (i.e. where the stock of this item will be held), e.g. 'Bar Store Room' Enter the required quantity in single units (i.e. total number of cans, not packs) in the ‘Opening Quantity’ box. Alternatively, if you don’t have any stock of this item at this point, leave the ‘Opening Quantity’ box empty. Click ‘Finish’ once all the required information has been entered. Please note some customers may only use and therefore have a single stock location, if so then there will not be multiple stock locations to select from in the 'Stock Location' drop down box. At the screen below click ‘OK’. Now you can either click the ‘Next’ button to add another item, or Click the ‘Cancel’ button to exit the ‘New Stock/PLU Wizard’.",

    "text": "TABLE OF CONTENTS Introduction Using the Stock Index Screen Using the Stock Maintenance Screen Selling and Stocking Codes/Units Stock Details Introduction Once you have created a ‘Stock Item’, it is often necessary to check and amend this information. In this manual we’ll be looking at how to edit a ‘Stock Item’ in the ‘Stock Maintenance’ Screen. Using the Stock Index Screen To access the ‘Stock Maintenance’ screen, we must first open the ‘Stock Index’ screen. To do this 1. click on 'Setup' then 2. click on 'Stock' then 3. double click on 'Stock Index'. The ‘Stock Index’ screen will now open, this allows you to search for, view and edit stock items. The most common way to search for an item is either by the description or item code / barcode. To search for a specific code, type or scan the required code in the ‘Scan/Enter Code’ box. Next click the ‘Search’ button. The search results will show in the above screen. If for any reason you wish to start a new search and clear the current search criteria, simply click the ‘Clear’ button. To search by the item description, simply type the required text in the ‘Description’ box. Click on ‘Search’ to display the stock items that meet the description criteria you entered. Please note typing e.g. Cola will find all items with the ‘Description’ starting with the word “Cola”. To find any stock items containing the word “Cola” please type %Cola. Selecting multiple options enables you to narrow down the search criteria. You can search by: Sales Suffix: Enter required sales suffix (if used) you want to search for in this box. Item Group: Use the dropdown to pick the required item group to search for. Valuation Group: Use the dropdown to pick the required valuation group to search for. Supplier: Use the dropdown to pick the required supplier to search for. Supplier Item Code: Enter required supplier item code you want to search for in this box. Unit: Use the dropdown to pick the required stock unit to search for. Quantity: Select from one of the following dropdown options: N.B. “stock above / below re-order level “options rely on the ‘Re-Order Qty:’ being set on stock items. Current List Price: Enter required list (selling) price you want to search for in this box. Cost Price: Enter required cost (purchase) price you want to search for in this box. Value Based on: In conjunction with the above, click the required cost to search for either the: ‘ Standard’, or ‘Average’, or ‘Latest Cost’ options. Limit Search to: This option is ticked by default, so a search will only return 100 results. Untick the box so there is no limit to the number of search results found. Alternatively, enter the number of search results you want to find in the box. Show Discontinued: Tick as required if you want the search to include ‘Discontinued’ stock items. Show Deleted: Tick as required if you want the search to include ‘Deleted’ stock items. Show G Margin: Ticking this will add an extra column to your search results. The additional column will show the ‘Gross Margin’ for the last ‘X’ months. Enter the number of months in the months box and then click search. Using the Stock Maintenance Screen Once you have found the item you wish to view / amend in the search results, double click on it. The ‘Stock Maintenance’ screen will now open for this stock item. The various icons and fields in this screen will now be explained in detail. Top Menu Bar Icons: Click here to create a totally new stock item (N.B. this creates a new stock record only). Click here to clone the existing stock record (N.B. this clones the current stock record only). Click here to mark the stock record as ‘Deleted’. Click here to go to the ‘Stock Adjustments’ screen (covered in a separate guide). Click here to create an ‘Internal Message’ (not covered in this manual). This button is the same as the Windows ‘Cut’ shortcut key combination. This button is the same as the Windows ‘Copy’ shortcut key combination. This button is the same as the Windows ‘Paste’ shortcut key combination. Click here to open the ‘Price List’ report screen. Click here to open the ‘Help’ screen (some versions of Windows may not support this). Bottom Menu Bar Icons: This button is an alternative way to access the ‘Stock Adjustments’ screen. This button is an alternative way to create an ‘Internal Message’. Click here to ‘Save’ any changes made in this screen. This button is an alternative way to create a new ‘Stock Item’ (see above*). This closes the ‘Stock Maintenance’ screen. This button is an alternative way to access the ‘Help’ screen (if available on your Windows version) Next, specific sections of the ‘Stock Maintenance’ screen will be covered in detail. The left hand section of the screen is called ‘Selling and Stocking Codes/Units’. The the right hand section of the screen is called ‘Stock Details’. The contents of these two sections will now be covered in more detail. Selling and Stocking Codes/Units First, the fields in the ‘Selling and Stocking Codes/Units’ section of the screen will be explained. First, the fields in the top half of this screen will be explained in detail. Item code: This is the item’s assigned code. Unit: This is the assigned \"unit of measurement\" used for stocking this item. Conv Factor to Stocking unit: This is required in cases where \"fractional stock\" is used. This is most often used for hospitality/catering environments, where the base stock unit ordered is not sold, but fractions of it are. For example, beer is ordered and delivered as an 11 gallon barrel but you only sell it in pints, or where wine or spirits are supplied in bottles but are also sold in glasses or shots. This is what we refer to as \"fractional stock\" where the stock item delivered is also sold in multiple sizes or \"fractions\" of that main stock unit that was delivered. This is covered in a separate guide. Price Lookup: From here you can search for / create / remove a linked PLU. (N.B. if linked to a PLU, the ‘Current List Price’ box will be populated with the current PLU price) Next, the fields in the bottom half of the ‘Selling and Stocking Codes / Units’ screen will be explained. This screen shows the codes / barcodes currently used to sell this stock item. In the above example, you will notice there are 3 barcodes for this stock item. This can be the case where exactly the same product is delivered but e.g. the manufacturer's barcode on the packaging has changed. In this scenario the new barcodes need to be added. Should you need to add another code / barcode for this stock item, click ‘Add Code’. The ‘Item code’ field will now be blank. Enter the required code in the ‘Item Code’ box ( either manually or by using a barcode scanner if you have one installed). Click ‘Apply’ then ‘Save’. To remove unwanted codes simply click on the code, so it is highlighted yellow (as shown below). Next click ‘Remove Code’. The code will now show with a line through it. At this point you will also have the option to click the ‘Reinstate’ the code button, if this was done in error. If you are sure you want to remove this code / barcode, then click ‘Save’. Stock Details Next, the fields in this area of the ‘Stock Details’ section will be explained. First, the fields at the top of the 'Stock Details' screen are shown and explained below. Stocking Unit: The unit of measurement this item is stocked in. Pack Size: How many (of the ‘Stocking Unit’) are in a pack. For example, Mars Bars come in boxes of ‘48’. Therefore when ordering you would do so in multiples of ‘48’. Track Qty: If this box is checked, the system will track the quantity of this stock item and deduct from the number in stock automatically, when a sale of the corresponding PLU code is made. Discontinued: If this box is checked the item will not be available in the ‘Purchase Order’ / ‘Stock Adjustments’ system in ‘K3 MStore’, unless in your search you tick the ‘Show Discontinued’ option. Next the fields at the middle of the 'Stock Details' screen are shown and explained below. Re-order Level: This is the stock level at which you want to re-order this item. N.B. the software will not warn you, or automatically send an order for you when your stock goes below this level. There is a report to show you stock items that have fallen below this level (the ‘Stock Re-Order Report’.) and in the ‘Purchase Order’ module there is the ability to generate an order for stock items that have fallen below this level. Re-order Qty: This is the stock level the software will suggest to re-order when: (i) using the ‘Purchase Order’ system option to generate an order based on stock falling below the re-order level, or (ii) or when running the ‘Stock Re-Order Report’. Qty On Hand: Displays the total quantity (of the selected ‘Stocking Unit) that is currently in stock N.B. if you have multiple stock locations, click the icon for the quantity in each stock location On Order: Displays the quantity (of the selected ‘Stocking Unit) that is currently on order. Max Qty: The maximum quantity of (the selected ‘Stocking Unit) that you do not want to exceed. (this is generated automatically as a sum of re-order level and quantity field but can be edited). Standard Cost: The standard cost of the item to your business. Latest Cost: The cost of the item on the most recent delivery. Average Cost: The average cost (calculated by the software) of this item to the business. Weight (kg): Item weight in kilograms. N.B. this is typically only required for calculating postage costs on the ‘Online Shop’ page So this is really only used if you have purchased the ‘Online Shop’ Module. If you do not have the online shop, you could enter the item weight here for information only. However, his would often already be part of either the stock item description or stock unit. Finally, the fields at the bottom of the 'Stock Details' screen are shown and explained below. Size: Any other details regarding the size of the item can be typed here (for reference purposes only). Warehouse Bin: If required, you can type in a physical location of the item in the warehouse (for reference only). Valuation Group: Which ‘Stock Valuation’ group this stock item belongs (used by the ‘Stock Valuation Report’) Usual Supplier/Alternate Supplier: Select the usual supplier from the relevant dropdown. If required you can also select an alternate supplier for the stock item. Supplier item code/Alt item Code: If required, enter the suppliers / alternate suppliers own reference code for the item here. Notes: Any additional information for this product (for reference only). N.B. please remember to click ‘Save’ after amending any stock item data in this screen. Alternatively, click ‘Cancel’ if you do not want to save the changes that were made.",

    "title": "Stock Adjustments",
    "text": "TABLE OF CONTENTS Introduction Finding the Stock Adjustment Screen Entering a Stock Adjustment Introduction The 'K3 MStore’ software has the ability to adjust the stock levels of stock items using the ‘Stock Adjustments’ option. This functionality can be used to adjust the stock levels by increasing, decreasing, or overwriting the stock level of an item at a time in a specified ‘Stock Location’. The full scope of what can be achieved using ‘Stock Adjustments’ in our 'K3 MStore’ software software is covered in this manual. If you have multiple ‘Stock Locations’ set up in the ‘K3|mstore’ software, then there will also be the ability to transfer the required quantity of a stock item between ‘Stock Locations’. This functionality can be used to deliver stock, so that it is added to your stock holding for a specific stock location. Although this is a simple way of entering deliveries into the 'K3 MStore’ software, this does require deliveries to be entered an item at a time. There is also no way of reviewing the previous stock adjustments made in this screen, or to e.g. associate all the stock items delivered as being part of one \"delivery note\". If you are wanting to use more advanced functionality that allows you to build an order with a specific order reference that contains multiple stock items, then the ‘Purchase Order’ functionality may be better suited to your requirements. The ‘Purchase Order’ functionality allows an order to be reviewed and amended before it is delivered, and both order and delivery notes to be printed. In addition, any order can also be viewed after it has been delivered, so the ‘Purchase Order’ system is more suited to customers that need to have a greater degree of control and auditability over their purchasing process. Our 'Purchase Order’ functionality in the 'K3 MStore’ software is covered in a separate guide. Finding the Stock Adjustment Screen First 1. click on ‘Setup’ then 2. click on ‘Stock’ then 3. double click on ‘Stock Adjustments’. Entering a Stock Adjustment On double clicking ‘Stock Adjustments’, you will now see the following screen. You must now enter the code of or find the item you want to adjust the stock level If you have the item code to hand it can be typed in the code field directly, then press the enter key on your keyboard. Alternatively, if a scanner has been purchased from and installed by K3, the item barcode label could be scanned to select it. If this information is not to hand and the item code is not known then click the binoculars button at the top of the screen, Enter the required criteria to find the item in the 'Search Criteria' fields, then 1. click the 'Search' button. Click on the required stock item so it is highlighted yellow, then click the ‘Use Selected Item’ button. You will now see the selected stock item’s details here. You will also notice that the main supplier for this item has already been selected. Now you must select the ‘Adjustment Type’ from the relevant drop-down list. The different types of stock adjustments are explained below: Stock Receipts from Supplier: This option will ADD TO the stock level for this item, at the selected stock location. This option can be used for entering deliveries of stock items. Add to/Return to Stock: This option will ADD TO the stock level for this item, at the selected stock location. N.B. this will add the item to the stock level of this item (but will not be recorded in sales reports). Stocktake (Replace Quantity Figures) This option will OVERWRITE the stock level for this item, at the selected stock location. (most commonly used to correct a count error entered during the ‘K3|mstore’ stocktake process). N.B. this is not how you enter a stocktake, a stocktake is a totally separate process in ‘K3|mstore’. Subtract From/Write-Off Stock: Selecting this option will DEDUCT FROM the stock level for this item, at the selected stock location. This option is used for writing off stock (e.g. wastage, breakage etc). Transfer to Another Stock Location: Please note stock transfers only apply to customers who have multiple stock locations. When using stock transfers, you must select both a ‘From Location:’ and a ‘To Location:’. Using ‘Transfer to another stock location’ option will: DEDUCT FROM the stock level for this stock item for the selected ‘From Location:’. ADD TO the stock level for this stock item for the selected ‘To Location:’. Sale (Item was Sold): Selecting this option will DEDUCT FROM the stock level for this item at the selected stock location. N.B. this will deduct from the stock level of this item but will not be recorded in sales reports. In this example we want to enter a delivery of a stock item, so select ‘Stock Receipts from Supplier’. For customers who have multiple stock locations, you must now select the correct stock location This the stock location that this item will be delivered to and increase the stock level of. For customers that do not have multiple stock locations, then only one stock locations is available. Typically this will be named the 'Main Stock Location' as this is the default stock location for a single stock location. However, please note the single stock location could have a different name, as this name can be amended in MStore. Next type in the required quantity in the ‘Quantity’ field. Please note at this point if this stock adjustment is to be posted for the current date / time then click the 'Ok' button. However, if you want to record the stock adjustment for a different date / time do not click the 'Ok' button. For example you want the stock adjusted yesterday at 10 am when the delivery actually came in. To do this click the 'Set date/time box'. You can now use the dropdown to the right of the 'Posting Date' to select the required date. The click on the hours (\"hh\") part of the time and enter the required hours in 24 hour clock format. Next click on the minutes (\"mm\") part of the time and enter the required minutes. Next (if required) click on the seconds (\"ss\") part of the time and enter the required seconds. With either the date left as it is, or with a past date selected, either click the 'Ok' button to post the adjustment. Alternatively, if you are not happy posting the adjustment click the 'Cancel' button to clear this form. When you click the 'Ok' button to post the adjustment you will see the following message pop up. The stock has been adjusted by the amount specified in the stock location selected. Repeat the above steps for the next stock item, double checking the data before posting each adjustment. Click the ‘Close’ button once all adjustments have been entered.",

Putting An Order Together There are two ways you can add stock items to your Purchase Order: (a) Manually, i.e. by entering a stock item at a time. (b) By clicking the ‘Auto Generate’ button and using this functionality to create the order. Manually Adding Stock Items You can begin to add stock items onto your purchase order by using the ‘Search’ icon, located in the ‘Items to Order’ section of the ‘Purchase Order Entry’ screen. This will open the ‘Stock Index screen’. The “Supplier” field is auto-filled, using your original selection. Click the ‘Search’ button. Click on the stock item you wish to add to your purchase order, so it becomes highlighted. Click the ‘Use Selected Item’ button. You will now be back at the main ‘Purchase Order Entry’ screen. Items to Order Fields. Next, ensure you have selected the correct item. Check the ‘Qty Ordered’ field. N.B. if you have set a ‘Re-Order qty:’ on this stock item, the ‘Qty Ordered’ will be is with this quantity. If required, you can edit the quantity by clicking in the ‘Qty Ordered’ box and enter the required value. When you have clicked ‘✓’, the item and qty information will be added to the order. Please Note: If you entered a ‘Pack Size’ when you set up this item, if the quantity entered is not a multiple of the specified pack size, a message will pop up “WARNING: this is not a multiple of the pack size!”. This is just a warning you can still place the order with the non-standard quantity. Likewise, if you entered a ‘Max Qty’ when setting up the stock item, if the quantity (i) in this single order, or (ii) for all pending orders, exceed the ‘Max Qty’ then a message will pop up “WARNING: this will result in over stocking!”. Again, this is just a warning you can still place the order with this quantity. If you see the above message, click ‘Ok’. You can then adjust the quantity as required, or proceed with the quantity entered. You will automatically have a blank field highlighted yellow (as seen below). To add your next stock item to the order, click the ‘Search’ (binoculars) icon and repeat the above process to above to check and specify the quantity you want to order. When all items have been added, they will now appear in the below screen. At this point check the all the information in the purchase order. Once you are sure all the details are correct, proceed to the section entitled Saving a Purchase Order. Auto Generate Feature Click on the ‘Auto Generate’ button to view a list of options you can select from. Please note if you have selected a specific stock location (using the 'Location' dropdown) then following pop up appears. If you want to view quantity information across all stock locations then change then click cancel. Change the stock 'Location' in the dropdown to 'Not specified at this stage'. You can then alter the stock location to be as required before you receive the items on the purchase order. The options are an easy to use tool for quickly re-ordering multiple stock items. Orders are generated using stock items that fit the criteria supplied using these tick boxes: Order all items from this supplier where the quantity is less than the re-order level Clicking this option adds all stock items with a current quantity lower than that of the re-order level. (to use this functionality you must set the re-order quantity and re-order level on the relevant stock items) Order all items from this supplier Clicking this option adds all items purchased from the selected supplier. You can remove individual stock items you do not want order, in the ‘Purchase Order Entry’ screen. Take into account other undelivered Purchase Orders Ticking this box will take into account stock items on other already on other, undelivered purchase orders. Include items where the re-order qty is zero Ticking this box will include stock items that don’t have a set re-order quantity. (this will add items where no re-order quantity has been set on a stock item) Only include items sold in the last X months Ticking this box will generate an order including items sold within the time period selected. This is useful because you may not want to re-order items Include items listed as Alternate Supplier Ticking this box adds stock items to the order, with this supplier selected as the alternate supplier (‘Alt Supplier’). Select applicable tick boxes and Click ‘Ok’. You will be redirected to the main PO screen. You will find listed, all stock items that fit the \"Auto Generate\" criteria selected. The Qty Ordered field is auto-filled using the reorder number assigned to the stock item. You can edit the Quantity by clicking in the Qty Ordered box and entering the value. Click ‘✓’, and the item quantity will be updated. If you need to remove an item from the order, simply highlight it and click the ‘X’.

Received so Far: This is for tracking your received items. Damaged: This shows how many damaged items received. Outstanding: Total outstanding amount on PO. Saving a Purchase Order At this point no data has been saved. The 'Order Status' can be seen in red text in the bottom left corner of the screen. Currently you will notice the 'Order Status' is set to 'Order not saved'. Once you have selected all stock items to order in their correct quantities, Click ‘Save’ to save the order. Please note if you have missed any mandatory purchase order data you will be reminded you need to enter this first. Once you have clicked 'Save' you will notice the 'Order Status' has now changed to 'Entered but not printed or sent'. N.B. after this data has been saved, you can then close the purchase order screen if you want to come back and work on it later. Please note once saved and closed, saved purchase orders can be found in Setup > Stock > Purchase Order List. However, we will proceed with the process of completing a purchase order without exiting it, to show the end to end process. To process the order to the next stage, you must click either the Email’ or ‘Print’. You will then be asked if you wish to ‘Lock purchase order from further amendments’ Select ‘Yes’. (1) If you clicked 'Print' this will open the MStore purchase order report which can be printed in the usual way. If you want to just view the report then close it, this will be treated as though it has been printed (to save actually printing it) (2) If you clicked 'Email' MStore will try and open Outlook and attach a PDF version of the above order. So this requires your IT Team to install Outlook (and check Outlooks own 'Trust Center Settings' allow 3rd party app access) The Supplier record in MStore must also have a valid email address entered for that supplier. You can then enter any additional and amend the email content as required and send the email via Outlook. Once either 1 or 2 has been done you will notice the 'Order Status' has now changed to 'Awaiting Delivery'. Please note If you see this message: “The Order has not been checked and/or authorised – so it will be a draft”, you will need to click the Order Checked and Order Authorised tick boxes if you have the appropriate permissions to do so. If you cannot do this you will need to ask a colleague with the relevant permission to do so, or ask a colleagues that can amend MStore 'Users' to change your 'Security Group' to one with permission to do this. N.B. order checking / authorising requirements can be disabled by those with access to Setup > System > System Options. These can be disabled in system options menu in the 'Stock' tab by unticking the options to 'Require Purchase Order Checking?' and 'Require Purchase Order Approval' then clicking 'Apply' and then 'Close'. If order checking / authorisation is in place, once this have been done, you will need to Email or Print the order as above. Please note if you need to amend a locked purchase order, you can unlock it by clicking ‘Unlock’. Again this requires your MStore 'User' to be in a 'Security Group' with the correct permission to do this. Once unlocked you can then add or deduct stock items from the Purchase Order as before. When you have completed any amendments, simply click ‘Save’ again. The you will need to again repeat the above process to wither Email or Print the order, when it will go back to \"locked\" and the 'Order Status' goes back to 'Awaiting Delivery'. Typically at this point you would then click 'Close' to exit this screen and wait for the order to be delivered. Searching for Existing Purchase Orders Once you have created any purchase order and got as far as saving that purchase order, or any stage beyond saving then all purchase order history can be found in the 'Purchase Order List' option. So to find any order that meets the above criteria, e.g. the order you just placed that was status 'Awaiting Delivery' you need to be in the 'Purchase Order List' option. This is found in MStore by: (1) click on ‘Setup’ then click (2) ‘Stock’, then double click on (3) ‘Purchase Order List’. By default this screen will not show any purchased orders. However if you simply click 'Search', the default selection criteria will find all 'Outstanding' purchase orders. This would include the purchase order that was awaiting delivery, but could also contain many other orders. To refine the search results you can first select the following criteria to help find your specific order Supplier: Select purchase orders for a specific Supplier Order Status: Select the purchase order status you want to find, Stock Item Barcode: Search by Specific Stock Item Barcode. Orders Placed From/To: Search by PO’s within specified date range. Departments: Select the 'stock location' that a purchase order was for. specific Department. Location: Select the 'stock location' that a purchase order was for. With the required selection criteria selected click 'Search' to see the search results. To open an order to receive / amend it, then double click the line for the relevant order. Receiving Goods After the Purchase Order has been sent via post/email and the stock arrives, there is s a simple process to ensure each item is accounted for accurately. If the order is cancelled, this can be actioned by clicking ‘Cancel Order’(1) If all items in the initial order are delivered, you can select (2)‘Receive All’. Click ‘Save’ and you will be prompted to select a stock location. After selecting the correct location click ‘OK’. A prompt will appear asking if you ‘want to spool barcodes for items received’. Click ‘Yes’(if set up previously this will print barcodes for each item) or ‘No’. Another prompt will follow asking if you ‘want to print goods inwards receipt’. Click ‘Yes’ or ‘No’. Alternatively you can (3) individually receive each item line and alter the quantity received. Receiving a Partially Delivered Order Sometimes you may receive only part of an order. For example, you may have ordered 480 of a specific stock item. The supplier only delivers 240. In this scenario you would need to adjust the ‘Qty to Rec’ve’ to be 240. To do this, first click on the specific stock item, so it becomes highlighted yellow. Click the ‘Qty to Rec’ve’ field and input the correct number of received items (e.g. 240) N.B. if receiving items that are damaged, input the quantity that are damaged into ‘of which broken’ field. Click the ‘Receive’ button. If an item has not been delivered click ion the item so it' highlighted yellow, then click ‘Cancel Line’. N.B. the program will automatically highlight the next stock item. Repeat the steps detailed to receive / cancel any stock items as required. N.B. by default any completed/cancelled lines will disappear from the order. These can be viewed by ticking this 'Show completed / cancelled lines' box. The items that have been completed (received) or cancelled with then show. Please now check if the 'Stock Location' selected is correct using the relevant dropdown selector. This is the stock location the stock will be delivered into. If not you will be prompted to select the stock location, do this using pop up screen below. After selecting the correct location (if required( click ‘OK’. Once the stock location has been checked and selected, hen click ‘Save’ at the bottom of the screen. A prompt will appear asking if you want to spool barcodes for all the stock items received’. This is only for those customers who have purchased from and had installed by K3, barcode label printers. Click ‘Yes’ if you want to print barcode labels for the entire quantity of items in this order. If you do not want to print any barcode labels at this point, click ‘No’. Please note, if you select Yes, and proceed with printing, this will print a barcode label for each of the items in the order. For example, if you ordered 500 Book A’s and 500 Book B’s, the system will then print 1000 barcode labels! Click ‘Print’ to proceed with printing the labels. Click 'Cancel' to exit this screen once any labels have printed (or if you decide not to print labels). Next, a prompt will appear as follows. Click ‘Yes’ to print this report, or ‘No’ if you do not want to at this point. If you clicked ‘Yes’, the following screen will be displayed. Clicking print will print a hard copy to the printer that has been selected. Clicking screen will open this report on screen, so you can view it. You can print a hard copy / export a report from this screen as usual from this screen. Click ‘Close’ to exit the above screen. You will now be back at the ‘Report Parameters’ screen, click ‘Cancel’ to exit this screen. You will now be back at the ‘Purchase order Entry’ screen, click ‘Close’ to exit this screen. You will notice that in the above example the order status now changed to 'Part Delivered'. This is because we only delivered in 240 of the 480 Mars Bars ordered. As this is the partial delivery it remains as an order until the remainder are delivered, or the remaining order is cancelled. How this remaining stock on this partial delivery is processed is dealt with in the next section. Receiving a Second Delivery If an order was partially delivered, the remaining items would arrive in a second delivery. In this scenario, it would be necessary to find and re-open a purchase order to receive the remaining items. This would be done using the Purchase Order List screen. Select the status 'Partially Delivered' will assist finding a partially delivered order quickly. However you may want to add to he selection criteria as required, to narrow down the search more quickly Once you have found the required Purchase Order, double click on it. This will open the Purchase Order Screen. From here you can follow the instructions in the section of the guide entitled Receiving Goods. In this case there is only one item in the order ‘Receive All’ can be clicked to receive all remaining items. Alternatively, to receive only specific items, simply click on the item you wish to receive . Please note, the ‘Qty to Rec’ve’ will autofill with the remainder of your order. You can now cancel / amend / receive each line as required and detailed in the previous sections. Once you have processed all necessary items, click the ‘Save’ button at the bottom of the above screen. Next, you will be prompted to select a ‘Stock Location’, if one was not already selected. After selecting the correct location using the dropdown, click ‘Ok’. As explained previously, a prompt will appear ‘Do you want to spool barcodes for items received?’. Click ‘Yes’ or ‘No’ as required. As explained previously ‘Do you want to print goods inwards receipt’. Click ‘Yes’ (to view / print the ‘Goods Inward Note’) or No’ as required. You have now completed the purchase order. Click the ‘Close’ button at the bottom of the ‘Purchase Order Entry’ screen to exit this screen. Next, the ‘Close’ button at the bottom of the ‘Purchase Order List’ screen to exit this screen.",

Performing a Zeroise Creating a Stock Count Sheet Printing the Stock Count Sheet Carry out the Stock Take Count Entering the Stock Take Count Adding Items to the Stocktake Deleting Items from the Stocktake Amending the Stocktake Count Accepting the Stocktake Count Finalising the Stock Take ‘Stock Take Variance (Landscape)’ Report 'Stock Take Variances' Report 'Stock Valuation' Report 'Stock Audit Trail' Report 'Stock Movements' Report Introduction This manual explains the procedure to carry out a paper-based stock take using the ‘MStore’ back office software. Carrying out the following process is only designed to be done while you are closed, so the tills should not be trading during this process. All stock adjustments and purchase orders should also be up to date before starting your stock take, so these need to be checked and processed as required in the ‘MStore’ software before you start the procedures explained in this manual. During this procedure the stock levels of the stock items involved are first reset to zero. The new count is then entered and this stock count can then be finalised, to enable you to easily get a report on the stock take variance. This will give the difference (variance) between the stock level immediately prior to starting this process and the new stock count figures entered. Please note if you need a copy of the current stock levels before doing the stock take, then please ensure you run and print or save the required stock reports at this point. These can be found in Reports > Stock Reports. Disclaimer: Please note that this manual requires the user to have prior knowledge and training on the MStore back office software. Where elements of the software are not explained, this is because these features need to be set up by an experienced user of the MStore software prior to using this manual. Please note that if further training is required on this or any topic, then please contact your Customer Success Account Manager for a quote for the required training. Opening the Stock Take Screen. After logging into ‘K3|mstore’ back office software, click on: 1. ‘Setup’ then 2. ‘Stock’ then 3. double click the ‘Stock Receipt/Take’ button. You will now see the below screen. The process of starting any stock take in ‘K3|mstore’ is to reset the stock take count of all stock items to zero (referred to as a “zeroise” of the stock). This process is explained in the following section. Performing a Zeroise Click on the ‘Start Stocktake/Zeroise’ button. You now must select which specific stock records are to be “zeroised” by doing the following: Select the required ‘Stock Location’ from the dropdown menu for which this stock take is being carried out. Select the required ‘Stock Group’ from the dropdown menu (select either a specific group or ‘All groups’). Select the required ‘Supplier’ from the dropdown menu (select either a specific supplier or ‘All suppliers’). Select the required ‘Valuation Group’ from the dropdown menu (select either a specific group or ‘All groups’). In the box under ‘Please enter a meaningful name for this zeroise/stock take’ enter an appropriate name. N.B. it is recommended to include information on what was counted, the count date and the name / initials of the person responsible, for example Main Store 01/01/20 John Smith. This will enable you to find this stock take zeroise, more easily later and this is also advised for auditing purposes. Please read the warning above, then click in the box here so the ü is showing. N.B. at this point we recommend that you note down the details of the above zeroise and the specific time that you carried out this zeroise, as this may be required to get your stock take variance report. Next click the ‘Ok’ button at the bottom of the above screen to proceed. At the below screen click the ‘Ok’ button. Next click the ‘Ok’ button. You will now be back at the screen shown below, so click on the ‘Close’ button. You have now performed a “zeroise” for the selected criteria, which is the start of the stock take process. Creating a Stock Count Sheet Select ‘Paper Stock Take’ from the ‘Data Source’ dropdown (in the '(1) Configure Stock Take Options' section) Ensure the ‘Adjustment Type’ is set to ‘Stock Take (Replace Qty Figs)’. Ensure you select the ‘From Location’ as the location for which this stock take is being carried out for. Now click on the ‘Create New’ button. Select the ‘Item Group’ from the dropdown (select a specific one or leave as ‘All Groups’). Select the ‘Supplier’ from the dropdown (select a specific one or leave as ‘All Suppliers’). Select the ‘Valuation Group’from the dropdown (select a specific one or leave as ‘All Valuation Groups’). Select the ‘Lines per page’ you want on your count sheet as required (minimum 10, maximum 60 lines per page). Select the ‘Order by’ as required (you can order the count either by ‘Barcode’ or ‘Stock Description’). In the ‘Stock Take’ box type in a detailed reference for this stock take count sheet as required. We recommend including e.g. the stock location, date and your name, or initials (e.g. Main Stores 01/01/20 JS). You can add extra information as required, so you can find this specific count sheet easily later. Next, click on the ‘Create Stock Take Sheet’ button. Now the count sheet has been created, click on the ‘Save’ button. Next click on the ‘Yes’ button. Once you have saved the stock take sheet, you can now print it. Printing the Stock Count Sheet Click on the ‘Print Stock Take Sheet’ button To print a hard copy of your stock count you first select the required printer, then click on the ‘Print’ button Once the copies have printed, click on the ‘Cancel’ button to exit the above screen. Next click on the ‘Close’ button. Carry out the Stock Take Count Now take the printed stock take count sheets and count your stock. Write the counts on the stock take count sheets that were printed in the previous section. Once the count has been completed on the stock take count sheets, go into Setup > Stock > Stock Receipt /Take. Now proceed to the next section of this guide. Entering the Stock Take Count To enter the stock take count figures into MStore you need to be on the below screen. In the ‘Data Source’ dropdown ensure that ‘Paper Stock Take’ is selected here. Also ensure that the ‘Adjustment Type’ is set to ‘Stock Take Replace Qty Figs’. Next ensure that ‘Stock Take’ is selected here, if not select it by clicking on it. From the ‘Filename’ dropdown, select the file name of the stock take you just created. Now click on the ‘Edit Stock Take Sheet’ button. Click in the ‘Counted’ box to the right of each item and type in the number counted. When you type in a figure and press enter, then the cursor automatically drops to the next line. You can also use the arrow keys to scroll up and down the stock count sheet as required. You can go to a specific page and line of the stock take count sheet. To do this type in the required information in the ‘Page’ and ‘Line’ boxes where shown, then press the arrow button. This will then take you to the specified page and line of the stock take count sheet. Please note a page break is indicated by a thick black line on the stock take count sheet. Once all the stock count values have been entered, check that they are all correct. Once all the count figures are checked, click on the ‘Save’ button. Now click on the ‘Yes’ button. Next click on the ‘Close’ button. Please note as long as you save this count sheet, you can go back into it and edit it as many times as you like. Once you are happy all the count has been entered and saved, you need to upload this count into MStore. This process is detailed in the next section. Loading the Stock Take Count Make sure that the ‘Data Source’ is selected as ‘Paper Stock Take’. The ‘Adjustment Type’ must also be set to ‘Stock Take (Replace Qty Figs)’. Next, select the ‘From Location’ as the stock location name that this stocktake is being carried out for. First ensure the 'Stocktake' option is selected by clicking on it. Next from the ‘Filename’ dropdown ensure you select the file name of the stock take you just created. Next click the dropdown arrow to the right of the date and time (that will be showing as 01 Jan 2000 00:00) A calendar will pop up on which you need to select the date that this count was completed on. Next click on the '00' for the hours and type in the hour when the stock take was completed (in 24 hour format'). Finally click on the '00' for the minutes and type in the minutes when the stock take was completed. N.B. at this point we recommend that you note down the date and time that you selected here, as this may be required to get your stock take variance report (see the Stock Take Reports section). Check again the time, date and year is correct: it must be after that of the zeroise (also future dates aren't allowed)! Next click on the ‘Upload and Complete Stock Take’ button on the above screen. As long as you see the correct stock location here, then click on the ‘Yes’ button. If the wrong stock location is shown on the above screen, then click ‘No’. You would then go back and follow the process on the previous page and select the required stock location You should now see the stock take count figures appear where shown. Please note at this point you should double check the stock take count figured entered are correct. Adding Items to the Stocktake If you notice an item is missing from the stocktake, then click on the ‘Add new Line’ option so that it is selected. Then click the binoculars button. Now use the search screen to find the item, e.g. type in a description (or code) then press the ‘Search’ button. If the search finds multiple items click on the specific stock item you want to add so that is highlighted yellow. If only one item was found as in the above search then it will be highlighted automatically. Once the required item is highlighted in the above screen, click ‘Use Selected Item’. Type in the required amount of stock you want to add in the ‘Quantity’ box. Click on the ü button to accept the quantity of this item. Repeat as required until all missing items have been added to the stocktake. Deleting items from the count data is covered in the next section. Deleting Items from the Stocktake You can also delete an item from the stocktake at this point if required. To do this click on the item so that it becomes highlighted yellow. Now click on the ‘X’ button and this item (and any count for it) will be deleted from the stocktake. Repeat as required to delete the necessary items from the stocktake. You can also edit the quantity of an item that has a count in the above screen, this is covered in the next section. Amending the Stocktake Count Alternatively, you can amend the quantity of an item that is already in the stocktake. To do so, click on the required item so that it is highlighted yellow. Now click on the ‘Update Line’ option, so that it is selected. Next type in the required count figure in the ‘Quantity’ box. Finally click on the ü button to accept the new quantity. Accepting the Stocktake Count Only once you are totally sure that all the stocktake figures are correct, click on the ‘OK’ button to proceed. At the next screen there is another ‘Ok’ button that must be clicked to confirm you want to proceed. Now you must wait for the stocktake to be uploaded and processed, which may take several minutes! Do not close the MStore software until the following screen appears! Once the above screen appears, click on the ‘Ok’ button. Please note at this point the stock holding figures of the stock items for the specific stock location, item group(s) and supplier(s) that you specified in this stocktake have now been updated with the count figures you entered. You can see this by running the relevant reports (see Stocktake Reports section below for the main stock reporting options). Finalising the Stock Take Please note there is an additional process to finalise the stock take. This is not mandatory (as the stock figures of the items you have entered a count for have been updated at this point), but it is recommended as: (1) This checks for any items that were zeroised and no count was enter but they have been sold since the zeroise. (2) This allows you to more easily get your stock take variance report, as you can select any finalised stock take by selecting its name from a dropdown in the relevant report. N.B. you can still get a stock take variance report if you do not do the finalise. However, to get this report you would need to have noted down the date and time of both the specific zeroise and stock take count! To start the process, click ‘Finalise Stocktake’. Select the name of the relevant zeroise you want to finalise, using the dropdown menu. As the paper-based stock take is designed to be done only when you are closed, then no stock items should show in the above screen. However, as a check if any stock items appear in this screen it means they were (a) zeroised and (b) did not have a count entered for them and (c) the stock items listed have been sold since the zeroise! Please note as a paper based stock take is designed only to be carried out when you are closed, only the option detailed below should apply. However, all the possible other scenarios are covered (see below) in case items were accidentally sold during a paper stock take. If no stock items are listed in this screen below (which would be as expected): Click the option ‘Don’t post anything just mark the stock-take as complete’ and click ‘OK’. You will then see the message ‘Stocktake Finalised’ in the centre of the screen. Click ‘OK’ to close this message. If stock items are listed in the above screen, there are 3 options: (1) Click the option: Record a zero stock take for the above items (the last item was sold since the stock location was zeroised therefore I couldn’t count it) This option will do exactly as it suggests, a zero will be entered as the count for the listed stock items. (2) Click the option: ‘Don’t do anything just mark the stock take as complete’ This means that the stock quantity of these stock items will remain exactly as they are currently. N.B. as there have been sales after the zeroise, this may mean that the stock quantity of these stock items are negative! If you want to check / amend this stock quantity before finalising the stock take, go to point 3 (below). If either option (1) or (2) were selected, then the next step is to click the ‘Ok’ button (at the bottom of the screen). At the next screen that shows the message ‘Stocktake Finalised’, click ‘Ok’ again. You have now finalised the stock take, so click the ‘Close’ button on the above screen to exit it. (3) Instead of proceeding, at this point you may want to first check the stock history of these stock items. If so, please take a screenshot of the stock items listed in the above screen and save it in your preferred software. Click the ‘Close’ button on the above screen and then check the stock levels and history of the items in question. You may want to go and re-count the stock of any items at this point, or you could use the stock reports to check the history for these stock items (in Report > Stock Reports). Many reports are available to check the history of stock movements but e.g. the ‘Stock Audit Trail’ report could be run for the required stock location, then use the search facility in the report to find the required stock items (see the next section for more details on reports). After running any reports to check the stock quantity and history, you may also want to update the quantity of any stock item(s) to be as required. This can be done using the ‘Stock Adjustments’ functionality in the usual way (Setup > Stock > Stock Adjustments) update the quantity of each stock item to be as required. Once you are happy to proceed, you would now go back to the start of this section and follow the process explained in this section of the manual. Stocktake Reports We recommend that you now go into Reports > Stock Reports and print off the various reports that you require. The main reports that most customers run after carrying out a stock take are detailed below: ‘Stock Take Variance (Landscape)’ Report This is found in Reports > Stock Reports > Stock Take Variance (Landscape). N.B. if you carried out the stock take as per this guide and finalised, use this report to get the stocktake variance. Pick the required stock take that you want to see the report for from the ‘Zeroise ID’ dropdown below. Print hard copies, view, or export the report as usual. N.B. if you did not finalise the stock take, then this report cannot be used to get the stock take variance. If so, then you would need to use the ‘Stock Variances’ report (see below). 'Stock Take Variances' Report If you have not finalised a stock take you must use this report to get the stock take variance. This report is found in Reports > Stock Reports > Stock Variances. N.B. in order to run this report to get any meaningful data, you must have made a record of the following: The date and time you carried out the relevant zeroise. The ‘Date and Time of Stocktake’ you specified for the relevant stock take count. Pick the specific ‘Stock Location’ and ‘Stock Group’ (latter if needed) to be as required. To get the variance you would need to set the: ‘From Date/Time’ to immediately before the zeroise date/ time. ‘To Date/Time:’ to immediately after the ‘Date and Time of Stocktake’ you selected. Print hard copies of the report, or view, or export it as usual. 'Stock Valuation' Report This report can be used to find the current stock valuation data for the selected parameters (shown below). This report is found by clicking Reports > Stock Reports > Stock Valuation Report Select the parameters from the above screen and then view, print or export the report as required. Please note select the ‘Detailed Information’ option to see the information for each stock item. N.B. the ‘Summary Information’ view will only show the total stock value for each ‘Stock Group’. 'Stock Audit Trail' Report This report can be used to find the detailed audit trail of every individual stock movement that happened for the selected parameters (shown below). This report is found by clicking Reports > Stock Reports > Stock Audit Trail Select the parameters from the above screen and then view, print or export the report as required. 'Stock Movements' Report This report can be used to find a summary for each stock item of the various stock movement types for the selected parameters (shown below). This report is found by clicking Reports > Stock Reports > Stock Movements. Select the parameters from the above screen and then view, print or export the report as required. N.B. ensure you select the required costing from the ‘Stock Cost Basis:’ dropdown before running the report. Footnote: If you cannot see any one of these reports, then first contact the relevant colleague at your organisation that is responsible for setting up and maintaining the ‘Users’ and ‘Security Groups’ in the MStore software. They may need to change / edit the ‘Security Group’ you are in to enable you to see the above reports. If you still cannot see the above reports, or you have issues when running these reports then please log a ticket wit our Support Team detailing the issue, the name of the reports (with screenshots of error messages if applicable) and the username you are logging on to MStore with and they will be able to assist.",

Performing a Zeroise Entering a Stocktake Editing a Stocktake Sending the Data to the Server Loading the Stocktake into MStore Adding Items to the Stocktake Deleting Items from the Stocktake Amending the Stocktake Count Accepting the Stocktake Count Deleting a Stocktake from the Device Finalising the Stocktake Stocktake Reports ‘Stock Take Variance (Landscape)’ Report ‘Stock Variances’ Report Stock Valuation Report Stock Audit Trail Stock Movements Introduction This manual explains the procedure to carry out a stocktake using a mobile stocktake device and how to process this in the MStore back office software. Please note, all stock adjustments and purchase orders should also be checked and processed as required prior to doing the stocktake. During this procedure the stock levels of the stock items involved are first reset to zero. The new count is then carried out on the mobile device and then uploaded to the MStore back office software. This stock count can then be checked and amended in MStore, before it is accepted and then finalised as the new stock holding. You will also be able to run a report to get the stocktake variance, which will give the difference (variance) between the stock level immediately prior to starting this process and the new stock count figures you entered. Please note if you need a copy of what the current stock levels were before doing the stocktake, then please ensure you run and print or save the required stock reports before starting this stock taking process. These can be found in Reports, then Stock Reports in the MStore and the main reports are covered at the end of this guide. Please Note: If you do not currently have stock take scanners and wish to enquire about the cost of hardware, setup and training then please contact your Account Manager. In order for these devices to receive updated product files and also to be able to upload (send) the stocktake counts from the device back to MStore server, they will need to be connected to a wi-fi network, so that the device can communicate to the relevant server. N.B. your own IT provider is responsible for connecting the device to the correct wi-fi network (one that can connect to MStore database server) and for supporting any issues due to problems with your wi-fi network. However if your IT team have issues connecting the device to to a wi-fi network then please raise a ticket with the K3 support team. If the device has already been set up and tested by our Support Team, then please ensure that the device has connection to the correct wi-fi network and the signal strength is good (before you try receive or send data (e.g. update the product file or send back the count to MStore). Opening the Stocktake Screen. After logging into MStore back office software, click on: 1. ‘Setup’ then 2. ‘Stock’ then 3. double click the ‘Stock Receipt/Take’ button. The process of starting any stocktake in MStore is to first reset the stocktake count of all stock items to zero. This process is referred to as a ‘zeroise’ of the stock and is explained in the following section. Performing a Zeroise Please note, you must carry out this process before you start your stock take count. Click on the ‘Start Stocktake/Zeroise’ button. The following screen will appear. You now must select which specific stock records are to be zeroise’. Select the required ‘Stock Location’ from the dropdown menu for which this stocktake is being carried out. Select the required ‘Stock Group’ from the dropdown menu (select either a specific group or ‘All groups’). Select the required ‘Supplier’ from the dropdown menu (select either a specific supplier or ‘All suppliers’). Select the required ‘Valuation Group’ from the dropdown menu (select either a specific group or ‘All groups’). In the box under the text ‘Please enter a meaningful name for this zeroise/stock take’, it is recommended to include information on what was counted, such as the count date and the name / initials of the person responsible. For example, you may enter the for this zeroise / stocktake as Main Store 01/01/20 John Smith, as doing this will enable you to find this stocktake zeroise more easily later for reporting / auditing purposes. IMPORTANT NOTE: Please note the zeroise is designed to be done as the first process, before you start the stock take count. When you carry out this process the software record the date of time you did this automatically. However, if you did forget to do the zeroise, then you can do this retrospectively but you will need to do this within 30 days. MStore only allows a date up to 30 days in the past to be selected for retrospective zeroises and this option will also not allow future dates to be selected. Only do this with extreme caution as if you do this process incorrectly, then it can adversely affect stock levels. If you are in any doubt about this process then please log a ticket with our Support team before using this option. If you forgot to zeroise and are happy do this retrospectively then click the box next to the 'Change Zeroise Date/Time' option so that it is ticked. You will then see some additional warning text and a date and time selector appear. Click on the dropdown arrow to the right of the date and time selector, then a calendar will pop up. Use this to select the required date. Next click on the hours so they are highlighted blue, then using you keyboard enter the required time in hours (in 24 hour clock format) when this zeroise should have been done. Then click on the minutes and enter the required time in minutes using your keyboard when the zeroise should have been done. Please check the date and time is selected is correct before you proceed as K3 could not advise when this date / time should be. Now double check to ensure all the data selected / entered in the below screen is as required. Please read the warning / disclaimer text at the bottom of the screen. Next click on the the tick box to the right of this warning message so it becomes ticked, to confirm you wish to proceed (the 'Ok' button at the bottom of the screen cannot be clicked until this box has been ticked). Alternatively if you are not happy to proceed at this point you can click 'Close' on the above, then 'Close' on the next screen. You can then do any checks you may need to do, then re-start the process from the start of this user guide. N.B. at this point we recommend that you note down the name of the above zeroise and the specific date and time that you carried out this zeroise, as this may be required later to get your stocktake variance report. Next click on the ‘Ok’ button at the bottom of the above screen to proceed. You will now see the following screen - click the ‘Ok’ button. At the bottom of the screen you will the progress of the zeroise. You must wait for this to finish. If you force close the software or shutdown your computer while this is happening this is likely to cause stock quantity issues. Once the zeroise has completed you will see the following message, click the ‘Ok’ button. You will now be back at the screen shown below. You have now performed a ‘zeroise’ for the selected criteria, which is the start of the stocktake process Click on the ‘Close’ button to exit the above screen. Entering a Stocktake As how to access the software can vary depending on your device, specific screenshots are not included in this guide. On your mobile stocktaking device open the stocktaking software so you see the below screen. Wait for this process to finish, and the following screen will show.

Next touch the ‘Ok’ button You will now be at the screen shown below The stock count has now been uploaded to your MStore server. Please note at this point the stock count has not updated the stock levels in the MStore back office software). The stocktake needs to be selected and loaded into MStore, where you can check and amend the count before accepting it as your new, starting stock level. The selected stocktake is then finalised to enable you to obtain the variance report for this specific stocktake. All these processes are explained in the following sections. Loading the Stocktake into MStore Login to the MStore back office software. Click on 1. ‘Setup’ then 2. ‘Stock’ then 3. then double click on the ‘Stock Receipt/Take’ button. You will now see the below screen. In the ‘Configure Stock Take Options’ section of the screen, select the ‘Stock Take Scanner’ option from the ‘Data Source:’ dropdown. Now under the ‘Upload Data’ section: (i) Select the ‘Stocktake’ option by clicking on it so it is selected. (ii) Click on the dropdown arrow (to the right of 'File name’) and select the relevant stock take you just uploaded N.B. if you have multiple stock take devices the each stock take starts with a number (prefix) that is specific to that device. (ii) After selecting the required stocktake filename, click the ‘Upload and Complete Stocktake’ option. You now must wait until the stocktake count data shows in the bottom half of this screen. You can now view, amend, delete and add items to this stock count. This is covered in the following sections. Adding Items to the Stocktake If you notice an item is missing from the stocktake, then click on the ‘Add new Line’ option so that it is selected. Then click the binoculars button. Now use the search screen to find the item, e.g. type in a description (or code) then press the ‘Search’ button. Click on the item you want to add to the stocktake so that is highlighted yellow, then click ‘Use Selected Item’. Type in the required amount of stock you want to add in ‘Quantity’ box. Click on the tick button to accept the quantity of this item. Repeat as required until all missing items have been added to the stocktake. Deleting items from the count data is covered in the next section. Deleting Items from the Stocktake You can also delete an item from the stocktake at this point if required. To do this click on the item so that it becomes highlighted yellow. Now click on the ‘X’ button and this item (and any count for it) will be deleted from the stocktake. Repeat as required to delete the necessary items from the stocktake. You can also edit the quantity of an item that has a count in the above screen, this is covered in the next section. Amending the Stocktake Count Alternatively, you can amend the quantity of an item that is already in the stocktake. To do so, click on the required item so that it is highlighted yellow. Now click on the ‘Update Line’ option here, so that it is selected. Next type in the required count figure in the ‘Quantity’ box. Finally click on the tick button to accept the new quantity. How to accept this checked / amended this stock take count in the MStore software is covered in the next section. Accepting the Stocktake Count Only once you are totally sure that all the stocktake figures are correct, click on the ‘OK’ button to proceed. At the next screen there is another ‘Ok’ button that must be clicked to confirm you want to proceed. Now you must wait for the stocktake to be uploaded and processed, which may take several minutes! Do not close the ‘K3|mstore’ software until the following screen appears! Once the above screen appears, click on the ‘Ok’ button. Please note at this point the stock holding figures of the stock items for the specific stock location, item group(s) and supplier(s) that you specified in this stocktake have now been updated with the count figures you entered. You can see this by running the relevant reports (see Stocktake Reports section below for the main stock reporting options). Once you are satisfied the count data has been successfully sent to the ‘K3|mstore’ software, you can delete this from the mobile device. This is explained in the following section, however please not this may not be required if you are on the latest version of the software as this process happens automatically, but it is good practice to do this to ensure a stock take is not left on the device. Deleting a Stocktake from the Device For some versions of the software this process may not be required as the stock take file is deleted automatically. However, it is worth carrying out this process to ensure any stock take is not left on the device for the next user. Please note this process will permanently delete the stock count data from the device! But please be aware this process will also permanently delete any stock transfer, or purchase order data that is held on this device, so please make sure any data that is required is checked and sent to the server before carrying out this process. On the device you need to press the ‘Data Tasks’ button (as shown below). At the next screen, press the ‘Ok’ button. Press the ‘Go’ button to the right of the text ‘Delete Collected Data From the handheld’ You will now see the message, click ‘Yes’ to confirm you wish to do this and proceed to the next step. N.B. if you follow the next step the stock count data will be permanently deleted from the mobile device! You will now see the warning message as shown below. Click ‘Ok’ to proceed (see the above warning) and the stock will permanently delete the stocktake from the device. You will now see the following screen. Click on the ‘Ok’ button to close this message box. You are now back at the screen shown below. The device is now ready to carry out another stocktake by following the same procedure. Finalising the Stocktake N.B. if you have finished counting all the stock for this location then you can now finalise the stock take. If not, then you would now follow the process as detailed in the previous sections to carry out all the other counts for the same stock location (i.e. you are using the device to do multiple, small counts that are part of one stocktake count). You would then only carry out the finalise only after you have uploaded all the counts into the MStore software for this specific stock location. This means that when you do the finalise, the software will recognise that all these stocktakes are for the same location and add them together to get the total stock count for this stock location. Please note that this additional process to finalise the stocktake is not mandatory (as the stock figures of the items you have entered a count for have been updated at this point), but it is highly recommended as: This checks for any items that were zeroised and no count was entered but they have been sold since the zeroise. This allows you to more easily get your stocktake variance report, as you can select any finalised stocktake by selecting its name from a dropdown in the relevant report (as opposed to having to manually select dates and times). N.B. you can still get a stocktake variance report if you do not do the finalise. However, to get this report you would need to have noted down the date and time of both the specific zeroise and stocktake count! To start the process, click ‘Finalise Stocktake’. Select the name of the relevant zeroise you want to finalise, using the dropdown menu. Although it is recommended to do any stocktake while you are not trading, a stocktake on a mobile device can be done while you are trading. If any stock items appear in this screen it means the stock items listed were: (a) zeroised and (b) did not have a count entered for them and (c) have been sold since the zeroise! If no stock items are listed in this screen: Click the option ‘Don’t post anything just mark the stock-take as complete’ and click ‘OK’. You will then see the message ‘Stocktake Finalised’ in the centre of the screen. Click ‘OK’ to close this message. If stock items are listed in the above screen, there are 3 options: (1) Click the option: Record a zero stock take for the above items (the last item was sold since the stock location was zeroised therefore I couldn’t count it)’ This option will do exactly as it suggests, a zero will be entered as the count for the listed stock items. (2) Click the option: ‘Don’t do anything just mark the stock take as complete’ This means that the stock quantity of these stock items will remain exactly as they are currently. N.B. as there have been sales after the zeroise, this may mean that the stock quantity of these stock items has gone negative! If you want to check / amend this stock quantity before finalising the stocktake, go to point 3 (below). If either option (1) or (2) were selected, then the next step is to click the ‘Ok’ button (at the bottom of the above screen). At the next screen that shows the message ‘Stocktake Finalised’, click ‘Ok’ again. You have now finalised the stocktake, so click the ‘Close’ button to exit the above screen (at the bottom of the screen). (3) Instead of proceeding, at this point you may want to first check the stock history of these stock items. If so, please take a screenshot of the stock items listed in the above screen and save it in your preferred software. Click the ‘Close’ button on the above screen and then check the stock levels and history of the items in question. You may want to go and re-count the stock of any items at this point, or you could use the stock reports to check the history for these stock items (in Report > Stock Reports). Many reports are available to check the history of stock movements but e.g. the ‘Stock Audit Trail’ report could be run for the required stock location, then use the search facility in the report to find the required stock items (see Stock Reports section below for more details on reports). After running any reports to check the stock quantity and history, you may also want to update the quantity of any stock item(s) to be as required. This can be done using the ‘Stock Adjustments’ functionality (Setup > Stock > Stock Adjustments) in the usual way update the quantity of each stock item to be as required. Once all the stock levels are checked / adjusted go back to the start of Finalising the Stocktake section and follow the process again. Once the finalise has been carried out, you are now ready to view the relevant stock take reports. Stocktake Reports We recommend that you now go into Reports > Stock Reports and print off the various reports that you require. The main reports that most customers run after carrying out a stocktake are detailed below: ‘Stock Take Variance (Landscape)’ Report N.B. if you carried out the stocktake as per this manual and finalised it then use this report to get the variance for this stocktake. This is found in Reports > Stock Reports > Stock Take Variance (Landscape). Pick the required stocktake that you want to see the report for from the ‘Zeroise ID’ dropdown below. Print hard copies, view, or export the report as usual. N.B. if you did not finalise the stocktake, then this report cannot be used to get the stocktake variance. If so, then you would need to use the ‘Stock Variances’ report (see below). ‘Stock Variances’ Report If you have not finalised a stocktake you must use this report to get the stocktake variance. This report is found in Reports > Stock Reports > Stock Variances. N.B. in order to run this report to get any meaningful data, you must have made a record of the following: The date and time you carried out the relevant zeroise (see Section 2). * The date and time of the last count entered for this specific stock take. ** Pick the specific ‘Stock Location’ and ‘Stock Group’ (latter if needed) to be as required. To get the variance you would need to set the: ‘From Date/Time’ to immediately before the zeroise date/ time. ‘To Date/Time:’ to immediately after the ‘Date and Time of Stocktake’ you selected. Print hard copies of the report, or view, or export it as usual. Stock Valuation Report This report can be used to find the current stock valuation data for the selected parameters (shown below). This report is found by clicking Reports > Stock Reports > Stock Valuation Report Select the parameters from the above screen and then view, print or export the report as required. Please note select the ‘Detailed Information’ option to see the information for each stock item. N.B. the ‘Summary Information’ view will only show the total stock value for each ‘Stock Group’. Stock Audit Trail This report can be used to find the detailed audit trail of every individual stock movement that happened for the selected parameters (shown below). This report is found by clicking Reports > Stock Reports > Stock Audit Trail Select the parameters from the above screen and then view, print or export the report as required. Stock Movements This report can be used to find a summary for each stock item of the various stock movement types. The parameters that can be selected when running this report are shown below. This report is found by clicking Reports > Stock Reports > Stock Movements. Select the parameters from the above screen and then view, print or export the report as required. N.B. ensure you select the required costing from the ‘Stock Cost Basis:’ dropdown before running the report. Footnote: If you cannot see any one of these reports, then first contact the relevant colleague at your organisation that is responsible for setting up and maintaining the ‘Users’ and ‘Security Groups’ in the MStore’ software. They may need to change / edit the ‘Security Group’ you are in to enable you to see the above reports. If you still cannot see the above reports, or you have issues when running these reports then please log a ticket with our Support Team detailing the issue, the name of the reports and the username you are logging on to MStore with and they will be able to assist. If there are any error messages, please include those in the support ticket detailing which report the error message was for and ideally a screenshot of the report parameters selected (like the above screenshot example)",

    "text": "TABLE OF CONTENTS Introduction Create the “Finished Product” Stock Item Opening the Recipe Maintenance Screen Recipe Maintenance Screen Content Recipe Section - Overview Ingredients Section - Overview Preparation Section - Overview Make This Recipe! Section - Overview Creating a Recipe Recipe Section Ingredients Section Adding Stocked Items into a Recipe Adding Non-stocked Items into a Recipe Printing a Recipe Preparation section Photos Preparation Method Making the Recipe Introduction This manual explains the ‘Recipe Maintenance’ functionality in the ‘K3 MStore’ back office software. This document is aimed at customers that wish to use ‘Recipe Maintenance’ to convert combinations of “ingredient” stock items (that are defined in a ‘Recipe’) into a “finished” product stock item. An example of this would be where a ‘Chocolate Cake’ (the “finished product” stock item) is created from its raw “ingredient” stock items, e.g. flour, eggs, sugar, butter, cocoa powder (etc) 'stock items'. On making a quantity of a recipe ‘K3 MStore’ will deduct from the relevant “ingredient” stock items and add to the stock of the relevant “finished product” stock item at the selected stock location. Create the “Finished Product” Stock Item The easiest way to set up the “finished product” stock item is by using the ‘New Stock Wizard’. This can be located by clicking 1. Setup then 2. clicking Stock then 3. double clicking New Stock Wizard. Select the ‘Stocked Item’ option. Enter the information as required in this screen as usual (a separate guide covers stock item creation). The bare minimum information required in this screen is to: Select the ‘Item Group’ from the drop-down (e.g. ‘Tray Bakes’) Enter the required ‘Stock Description’ (e.g. ‘Chocolate Cake’) N.B. although the ‘Valuation Group’ is not mandatory, it may be beneficial to select the required 'Valuation Group'. This is an additional (user definable) stock reporting grouping structure that can be used in stock reports with the 'Valuation Group' filter option. Please note the 'Valuation Groups' can be created as required in Setup >System > Lookup Items. As stock items in question are usually batch cooked in-house, these are not usually ordered from a specific supplier. This means that the ‘Re-order level:’, ‘Re-order qty:’ and ‘Maximum qty:’ would not normally be required in this scenario. If so, these fields can be left blank or enter the information as required by typing the required number. Please see the descriptions to the right of each of the above fields for information as to what each of the fields is used for. These fields relate specifically relating to automatic 'Purchase Order' generation functionality (and related reports) that is covered in a separate guide. The ‘Standard cost:’, ‘Latest cost:’ and ‘Avg cost:' (average cost) do not need to be entered at this point. The cost will be updated once this stock item is linked to a recipe, which is explained in the following sections. 'Main Supplier’ is not mandatory as this item is not supplied it is cooked in house, but you may want to create an internal supplier(s) for such 'Recipe' stock items, e.g. \"Catering Department\" and select this. This will be helpful in the future for filtering data when searching for products and will also be useful for running reports that have a ‘Supplier’ selection in the report parameters (filters). So, it is recommended that you create an internal supplier(s). Please note that can be done by clicking the 'Suppliers' button and creating a 'Supplier' in the usual way then selecting it, however if deemed as not required then this can be left blank as it is not mandatory for the reason given above. Option 1: If this “finished product” stock item will be sold at the till (if not see Option 2) Ensure this box is ticked and fill in all the required data in the below screen as usual. If there are any printing / order requirements, tick the ‘This is a food Item’ box and select the required option(s). These options are covered in full in a separate document, however the basic one to consider is whether when buying the item at the till then does this sale need to be also sent through to your kitchen printer(s), if so the 'Kitchen order item:' box will need to be clicked, so it becomes ticked. If will also need to edit the PLU once it has been created and select the specific Kitchen Printer(s) that this PLU will send to when sold at the till. Full details of setting up PLUs that willbe sent to kitchen printers is covered in a separate guide. Option 2: If this “finished product” stock item will not be sold at the till. Ensure this box is unticked and simply click ‘Next’ (i.e. do not enter any other data in this screen). At the following screen simply click ‘Next’ (i.e. do not enter any other data in this screen). At the following screen enter a ‘Code’ for this “finished product” stock item (e.g. CHOCTRAYBAKE). Next click the ‘Add’ button. The stock code will now appear highlighted in yellow where shown. Next, click the ‘Finish’ button. You have added this stock item and you will now see the message below. Click ‘Ok’. You will now be at the below screen and you can repeat the steps to add a new 'Stocked Item' if required. In this example we will now exit this screen by clicking the 'Cancel' button. The “finished product” stock item that you have just created now needs to be linked to a ‘Recipe’. This process is detailed in the following sections. Opening the Recipe Maintenance Screen First open the ‘Stock Index’ screen by 1. clicking on 'Setup' then 2. click on 'Stock' then 3. double click on 'Stock Index'. Use the following screen to search for the required stock item in the usual way, and double click the record to open it. You are now in the ‘Stock Maintenance’ screen of the “finished product” stock item. Next click on ‘Edit’, then click on the ‘Recipe’ button. Recipe Maintenance Screen Content The ‘Recipe Maintenance’ screen will now be showing. An overview of each of the sections of the above screen is given below. Then the criteria referred to in the below overviews are explained in detail later in this guide. Recipe Section - Overview In the ‘Recipe’ section the following information is defined: The name of the recipe The stock item that will be produced on making this recipe Quantity of the above stock item that will be produced when a batch of this recipe is made. Ingredients Section - Overview In the ‘Ingredients’ section the following information is defined: Stocked items and quantities deducted from stock when this recipe is made. Non-stocked items and quantities consumed (these is for information only in a recipe).

Section - Overview In the ‘Make This Recipe!’ section the following information is defined: Quantity of the recipe “finished product” stock item that will be produced. The ‘Stock Location’ to remove ingredients from and add the “finished product” stock item to. Creating a Recipe Please note before creating a ‘Recipe’ you must have first added all the relevant “ingredient” stock items. (i.e. stock items for all the ingredients of this recipe, e.g. eggs, butter cocoa, flour, sugar etc). This is outside the scope this document as this is covered in a separate guide. You must also create a stock item that will be the end product (e.g. a ‘Chocolate Cake’ stock item). This part was covered earlier and so we need to be in 'Recipe Maintenance' screen (below) of the stock item product you created. The data entry requirements of each section of this screen are now detailed below. Recipe Section Recipe Name: This is pre-populated with the “finished product” stock item’s description. If required, this can be changed by typing the relevant description in this field. This Recipe Makes: These two fields are used to indicate the quantity of stock that this recipe will make. Enter the required value in the quantity field. Select the required ‘Stock Unit’ from the drop-down.

Repeat the above process steps to add all the other “ingredient” stock items into the recipe. Adding Non-stocked Items into a Recipe Non stocked ingredients option really just allows you to enter a quantity and a text description line into a recipe for ingredients that are not in the ‘K3 MStore’ software. These are really to add information into the recipe that are for reference only, but are not 'stock items' in MStore. To do this click on ‘Add Non-stocked Ingredient’. Enter the required number in the ‘Qty:’ box. Enter the ingredient ‘Description’ as required. Click ‘Apply’. Repeat the above process steps to add a line for any other ‘Non-stocked Ingredient’(s) into the recipe. Printing a Recipe To print out this recipe, click the 'Print Recipe' button. Select the required printer and number of copies as required and click the 'Print' button to print hard copies on the printer. Alternatively, click the 'Screen' button if you want to view this report before printing to see the report (sample below). You can then click 'Close' to exit this screen ad then click 'Cancel' to exit the next screen. You will now be back at the 'Recipe Maintenance' screen.

This guide details from start to finish what needs to be done in the software before you can take bookings. Please note that without following all the steps detailed in this manual, you will not be able to take bookings. Bookings are generally used where you either (i) do not have any capacity management requirement for a specific bookable ticket ('Bookable Resource' in MStore), capacity essentially is \"unlimited\" and not restricted to any maximum (ii) or you have a set capacity for a specific 'Bookable Resource', for example you have a generic 'Day Ticket' but you can only sell 2000 per day. Where there is the requirement to strict manage the capacity so that (i) a combination of ticket types make up the capacity, e.g. the capacity is 2000 but is made up of Adult Child and Concession day tickets (ii) or where there are multiple times throughout the day for an event / activity and time needs need a capacity (that can be the same or unique per time), then this is typically set up using 'Sessions'. Setting up 'Sessions' to be booked / sold in-house and online is covered in a separate user guide. This would be typical for capacity managed day tickets where there are multiple ticket types making up the capacity, for example guided tours and trains running multiple times per day, \"Santa's Grotto\" tickets etc. Creating New Price Lookups (PLU’s) First you need to create all the required PLU’s that can be booked. To do this click on 1. ‘Setup’, then 2. ‘Pricing’, then 3. double click on the ‘New PLU/Stock Wizard’ icon. Creating a New Admission Ticket PLU First select the type of PLU you wish to create using the wizard. For this example, click on the circle to the left of ‘Admission Ticket’ to select it. Click on the ‘NEXT’ button. Click in the ‘Short description’ and enter the PLU description required. The ‘Short Description’ is the description that shown on the till and on receipts. This should be limited to 20 characters and should not include any punctuation. The ‘Long Description’ field is auto populated with the same information typed in the ‘Short Description’ box. The ‘Long Description’ is used on the reports in the MStore back office software, To modify this click in the ‘Long Description’ box and amend the info in the relevant fields as required. Now you must now specify the ‘Pricing Type’. In this specific example we have selected ‘Do not allow’. This option means the price of the PLU cannot be manually changed by anyone at the till. Now select the required ‘Analysis Code’ by clicking on the dropdown selector (to the right of 'Sales Analysis Code') Alternatively, use the ‘Analysis Codes’ button if you are familiar with how to select an ‘Analysis Code’ using this way. From the dropdown list that appears, click on the required ‘Analysis Code’ to select it. In the above example we selected the ‘Analysis Code’ called Admissions. Now select the required ‘VAT code’ by clicking on the dropdown arrow (to the right of the test ‘VAT code’). From the dropdown list that appears, select the ‘VAT code’ you require (in this case 'S' for \"Standard\" rate was selected) Click in the ‘Sell Price (Inc Vat) and type in the required selling price for this PLU (e.g. £10.00 is entered as 10.00). Next select the ‘Price Valid from:’ and ‘Price Valid to:’ dates as required. Please note if you want to start selling tickets from today (or a specific date) then the ‘Price Valid from:’ will need to be set to this date. Please note if this has bee set to a future for testing purposes you may need to edit this date to be able to test selling a ticket, then put it back to the required date after testing. To do this click on the arrow to the right of ‘Price Valid from:’ and the date selector calendar appears. Click on the text for the month (e.g. click on the text 'March' in the below example). The month selector appears automatically. Click on the required month in the month pop-up to select it. Next click on the text for the year (in this example click on the text '2025' at the top of the pop-up) You will see the up / down arrow selector appear to increase / decrease the year as required. Finally click on the date (in the selected month and year) that you want to start selling this ticket from. his will define the date and the process this ticket can be sold from this ticket can be sold from. Repeat the process to change the ‘Price valid to:’ date as required. This defines the last date that this ticket can be sold at the price specified. Please note he default price validity is for 10 years from the date the PLU was created, but you can set these dates to be as required. If there is no foreseeable price change or these tickets can be sold year round at this price, then you may want to set the end date to be way into the future (e.g. 31/12/2099). If tickets for an event can only be sold on certain dates e.g. from today (or from a specified date in the future ) until the day of the event only, then set the 'from' and 'to' dates as required. Please note when setting up a PLU in the Wizard you can only enter the first 'from' / 'to' price only as required. If you have a different prices for next year already, then additional prices for future dates can be added later by editing the PLU. This is referred to by K3 as \"Price Breaks\" and this is covered in a separate guide. This allows for one PLU code to hold multiple prices for when prices change annually for a ticket / event. This also allows for seasonal price changes, such as low, mid and high season price differences etc. This negates the need for adding multiple PLU codes for annual / seasonal price changes. However if your business decides you need separate PLU codes for price differences for its own reporting purposes this can be done, but this means you will have to create and multiple PLUs with similar codes / descriptions. New PLUs will also need to be assigned to the till screen button immediately prior to it being sold at the new price and the updates sent to the tills. This is all avoided by having one PLU code with multiple \"Price Breaks\" as the price will update automatically as specified. For customers that have purchased a financial integration or need to map MStore 'Nominal Codes' to PLU data for reporting purposes, then (if required) a first and second 'Nominal code' can be assigned to a PLU using the 'Nominal Codes' dropdowns. Financial integrations and 'Nominal Codes' mapping are outside the scope of this manual, if required please contact your Customer Success Manager and they will be able to provide a quote for your training needs. Click on the ‘Next’ button once all the data has been entered. If ‘Gift Aid’ is not to be claimed for this PLU, then leave this box un-ticked. If ‘Gift Aid’ is to be claimed for this PLU, then click in this box so a tick appears in it. If the ‘Gift Aid?’ box is ticked, you also need to specify whether you add an extra donation. N.B. if the ‘Gift Aid’ price includes an extra donation (i.e. the with gift aid price is higher), then click in this box so it is ticked. Please note the 'Tour / Session ticket' options are not covered in this manual as this is specifically covering NON SESSION based bookings set up. Setting up Session based bookings is covered in a separate guide. Now you must specify the footfall quantity to be recorded against this PLU as required. To do this click in this box and type in the required footfall (as a number, e.g. 1). If a ticket is to be printed when this admission PLU is sold, then click on the dropdown arrow to the right of 'Ticket type 1:'. From the list of available ticket types that appears, click on the required ticket design to select it. Colleagues that have had ticket design training will need to set these designs up before you set up the PLUs, so you can select the required ticket design. MStore provides some basic \"template\" ticket designs but these will no doubt need to be modified to add text, logos and content to meet your business needs. If you need training on designing tickets, please contact your Customer Success Manager and they will be able to provide a quote for your training needs. If required a second ticket design can be printed on selling this PLU. If so repeat the process using the dropdown to the right of 'Ticket Type 2:'. This could be used for printing a promotional offer but is often used only for train tickets where an outbound and return ticket is needed for travel. Now click on the ‘Next’ button to continue. Type in the code for the new admission PLU in the 'Code / Barcode:' field. Please use an alpha-numeric code when creating your own codes for PLUs. Simply decide on your own PLU coding system and ensure that all people entering new PLU’s use the same PLU coding system. The ‘Sell Unit’ Section is non-applicable for admission items so leave this as ‘Each’. Once you have typed in the required code, then click on the ‘Add’ button. Next click on the ‘Finish’ button to finish adding this PLU. You will then see the following screen. Now click on the ‘OK’ button. You have now set up one admission PLU for called “SUMMER EVENT ADULT ENTRY” at £10. You will now be taken back to the wizard screen. To create the other ‘Admission Ticket’ PLU’s for the summer event, Click on the ‘Next’ button and repeat the procedure to create all the other PLU’s required. For example, for the summer event we may create the following PLU’s: A PLU called “SUMMER EVENT ADULT ENTRY”, priced at £10.00 (as detailed in the above example). A PLU called “SUMMER EVENT SENIOR ENTRY”, priced at £8.00. A PLU called “SUMMER EVENT CHILD ENTRY”, priced at £4.00. In our example on the previous pages we used the wizard set up an ‘Admission Ticket’ type PLU. Please note that exactly the same procedure would be followed to create a: Non-Stocked Item. Admission Ticket. Bookable Item. Membership Item. Hire Item. You must first select the type of PLU you want to create. To set up any other type of item using the wizard, you simply first select the required item. For example, to set up a new ‘Non-Stocked Item’, first click the circle to the left of the text ‘Non-Stocked Item’. Then you simply click on the ‘Next’ button and follow the screens as per the previous example. The exception is when setting up a ‘Stocked Item’ using the wizard. Stock Items are usually sold using the 'Online Shop Module' (if this module has been purchased), so such items may not be required to be set up at this point If so, simply proceed to Section 3. If stock items are required, then setting up a ‘Stocked Item’ using the wizard contains additional screens. An example of how to use the wizard to create a ‘Stocked Item’ PLU is detailed in Section 2.2. Creating a Stocked Item Click on the circle to the left of the text ‘Stocked Item’ so that it is selected. Using the dropdown selector to the right of ‘Item Group’, select the ‘Item Group’ this item will be in for Stock Reports. If an appropriate ‘Item Group’ is not available a new one can be added via the ‘Item Groups’ button. In the ‘Stock Description’ field enter the required description for the stock system / reports. This can be different to the description used by the sales reports, these descriptions are added later in this process. Please note that in this manual only outlines the set-up of the simplest stock item, where the pack size of the stock unit is set as ‘Each’. This means that all purchase orders and adjustments of stock will be done as single units (‘Each’). So, for this example the stock unit must be set to ‘Each’. The ‘Pack Size’, ‘Weight’, ‘Size’ and ‘Bin Location’ can be entered as required and are for information purposes only. These are not required in this example, so these entries are left blank. The ‘Valuation Group’ is only used for the ‘Stock Valuation Report’, each stock item can be assigned to only one ‘Valuation Group’. This enables the Stock Valuation report to be filtered by the ‘Valuation Group’. Either select the required ‘Valuation Group’ from the dropdown list, or if you do not require one simply select ‘Not Defined’. If a new valuation group is required, this can be added by clicking on the ‘Lookup Units’ button located to the right hand side of the ‘Valuation Group’ box. Ideally these should have been set up in advance in Setup > Stock > Item Groups. Once the required valuation group has been selected, click on the ‘Next’ button. If you want to use the ‘Stock Re-Order Report’ in MStore and to generate recommended purchase orders, then you must enter the required information in these boxes. If you do not wish for the software to generate automatic recommended purchase orders or the ‘Stock Re-Order Report’, then you simply leave these boxes blank. The explanation of each of these fields is given below. ‘Re-order level:’ The number you enter here is the number of single items (not packs) that the Stock must fall below, in order for it to appear on both the software’s (i) ‘Stock Re-Order Report’ and (ii) when generating recommended purchase orders. ‘Re-order qty:’ The number you enter here is the number of single items (not packs) that will be re-ordered if the stock falls below the ‘Re-order level’ you specified. Once the item falls below this level it will appear on both the software’s (i) ‘Stock Re-Order Report’ and (ii) also when generating recommended purchase orders. ‘Maximum qty:’ The software will automatically calculate this value for you based on the ‘Re-order level’ and ‘Re-order qty’ you specify. The number here is the maximum number of single items (not packs) that you want to have in stock of this item at any time. The software will automatically warn you if you attempt to order / adjust stock of this item that will exceed the number you specified in ‘Maximum qty’. You can manually edit this number if required. If you do not require to use either the ‘Stock Re-Order Report, or for generating recommended purchase orders in the MStore back office software, then simply leave the above boxes blank. Now click in the ‘Standard cost:’ box and enter the usual cost of “buying in” a single item. N.B. do not enter the cost for the pack here, it is the cost per individual stock item (e.g. one bottle, can or cap)! So in this example it would be the “buying in” cost for a single baseball cap (e.g. enter £1.23 as 1.23). You will now notice that the software automatically populates ‘Latest Cost’ and ‘Avg cost’ with the figure you entered into the ‘Standard cost’. The ‘Latest Cost’ is the last cost of purchasing the item from the supplier. If for any reason you wish to enter a different starting ‘Latest Cost’ for this item, click in the ‘Latest Cost’ box and delete the value that is present. Now type in the required cost price in the relevant box. In this example the ‘Avg cost’ is the average cost of purchasing the item from the supplier. This is a calculated value which the MStore software will recalculate based on historical cost price changes. Once all the required cost information has been entered, click on the ‘Next’ button. Select the ‘Main supplier’ for this item by clicking on the dropdown arrow. Ideally these should have all been set up in advance in Setup > Stock > Suppliers. New Suppliers can be added at this point by clicking the Suppliers button. If required, enter the supplier’s own code (i.e. catalogue / ordering code) in the 'Main Suppliers Code' field. If required you can also specify a second, ‘Alternate Supplier’ for this item in the relevant fields (if applicable). Enter an ‘Alternate suppliers code’ for this item (if required). Click on the ‘Next’ button once all the necessary data has been entered. You will now see the below screen that you are familiar with, for creating the PLU for this stock item. In brief when you are in this screen you must do the following: Enter the required ‘Short description:’. Enter the required ‘Long description:’. Select the required ‘Pricing Type:’. Select the required ‘Sales analysis code:’. Select the required ‘VAT code:’. Enter the required ‘Sell price (Inc Vat):’. Select the required ‘Price valid from:’. Select the required ‘Price valid to:’. If required select the 1st and 2nd 'Nominal Codes' (see Section 2.1) Click on the ‘Next’ button once finished. If you are unsure about entering any of the above information, please follow the detailed steps in the previous example showing how to create an admission PLU (see Section 2.1). You will now see the screen below. In this example we are setting up a ‘Stocked Item’ So, in this instance (when setting up a 'Stocked Item') there is no need to do anything in this screen. Click on the ‘Next’ button to go to the next screen. You will now see the final screen. Enter the manufacturer’s barcode for the item in the 'Code / Barcode' field. alternatively if the item does not already have a barcode enter your own code for the item in this field. If using your own codes, we recommend using alpha-numeric codes. Once the code / barcode has been entered, click on the ‘Add’ button. Please note if you have stock of this item that you want to record that you have a specified number of this item, you can enter the quantity you have (in single items not packs) in the 'Opening Quantity' box and select the 'Stock Location' that will be updated with this quantity. This will save you creating an order / delivery of this item to get the stock level correct. Next click on the ‘Finish’ button which will complete the addition of this PLU. You will then see the following screen. Now click on the ‘Ok’ button. You have now set up a stocked item ‘Summer Event Baseball Cap’ at £10.00. Changing the Selling Price of a PLU To do this you need to 1. Click Setup 2. click Pricing then 3. double click Price Lookup Index. If you know the code then you can enter it in the code box and it will find that specific item, on clicking 'Search'. To limit the results it is often best to use a combination of search parameters to quickly find the item. In this case using 1. the item 'Category' dropdown and selecting 'Stock Item' from the dropdown limits the results to only 'Stock Items'. Most MStore 'Users' may not remember the code so often it is easiest to search 2. using the 'Description' field. If you know the item started with a word, then you can also search for all PLU’s that start with a certain word. For example, if you type SUMMER in the ‘Description’ box. However, it is often best to search for all PLU’s that contain a certain word, to do this you must type the % symbol before the word you wish to search for. For example, type in %SUMMER in the ‘Description’ to show all PLU’s with a ‘Description’ that starts with the word “Summer”. You can also select / enter data into the other fields to narrow searches down by 'Analysis Code', 'Session Type' (not applicable for non session based bookings as detailed in this guide), 'Selling Unit' and 'Current List Price'. 3. Click the ‘Search’ button, this will show all PLU’s with a ‘Description’ that starts with the word “Summer”. 4. Double click on the item you wish to change the price for (in this case the search only found one record) You will now see the screen shown below: To view, or amend the selling price for this item, click on the ‘View/Add Price’ button. Please note that the price you entered in the wizard, populates the ‘Inhouse Prices’ field. This is the price that the till will sell this item at. If the selling price of this item was incorrect when sold at the till, click in the ‘Price’ box. Delete the existing price and type in the new price as required. Once you have amended the price the ‘Apply’ button to save the changes. Please note the changes will NOT be at the till until you send the updated price(s) to the till (see Section 4) You will notice there is also an additional price field for ‘Internet Prices’. If you have purchased the ‘Online Bookings Module’ from K3 then this is the selling price of the item when it is sold on your MStore Online Ticketing Web Pages. If you have not purchased the ‘Online Bookings Module’, then the ‘Internet Prices’ field can be ignored. If you wish to change the selling price of this item when sold on the internet, enter it in the ‘Internet Prices’ field The internet price can be lower (or higher) than the price when sold at the till, as required by your business. Enter the correct price as required, then click on the ‘Apply’ button. Please note this price will not affect your online ticketing pages (if purchased from K3) until your web pages update process has been carried out. This is covered in Section 11. In this screen you can also amend the ‘VAT:’ rate (if required) by using the relevant dropdown arrow to select the VAT rate. If you make any changes you must click on the ‘Apply’ button. Once all the required changes have been made, then click on the ‘Close’ button. At the next two screens click on the ‘Close’ button. Please note you can also add any future price changes for the PLU (e.g. if you know the price changes next year), these are called \"Price Breaks\" this is outside the scope of this manual and is covered in another user guide. Sending PLU Changes to the Tills From the main menu select ‘Edit’ then ‘Recreate Till Data’. If you wish to send these changes to all tills, then just proceed to the next step. If you wish to send to selected tills, then click on the ‘+’ symbols until you see all tills. You can then right mouse click on a specific till to deselect it. Right mouse clicking on the same till again will select it. Once all the required tills are selected, click on the ‘Apply’ button to send the updates to all tills. You will now see a progress bar in the middle of the screen, like the one below. Once all the changes have been sent to the tills, you will see the following screen. Click on ‘OK’. Creating a New ‘Calendar Period’ Next you must create a ‘Calendar Period’ for this event, this specifies the dates on which this event can be booked. This will enable you to prevent items being booked outside of the agreed dates. In our example the summer event may run from 1st June until 31st August, so in this example you would set up a calendar that specifies these dates. This will allow bookings only to be made for the dates of the event. But we first recommend you check with your colleagues if a calendar has already been created that can be used for your event to avoid duplication. If not, then to create a new calendar 1. click Setup 2. click Bookings then 3. double click Calendar Periods. You will see a screen like the one showing below. Click on the ‘New’button. At the next screen that appears, again click on the ‘New’button. In the 'Code:' field type in an appropriate for this calendar (e.g. SUMEVENT1) Next click in the ‘Description: field and enter an appropriate description for this calendar (e.g. Summer Event). Once both the ‘Code:’ and ‘Description:’ have been entered, click on the ‘Apply’ button at the bottom. Next click on the ‘Close’ button. You will now see the new blank calendar. The next step is to select the required dates for the event you are setting up. Now use “click and drag” to select the required dates. To do this: Left mouse click on the first date but keep the left mouse button pressed down. Now drag the mouse across to the last date in the range of dates that you require. Now release the left mouse button (known as “click and drag”). (if this has been done correctly the selected dates should now be highlighted yellow - see below). Now click on the ‘Select’ button, the selected range of dates now be highlighted green. You will see a screen like the one below, showing the range of dates you selected highlighted in green. Repeat the steps on the previous page, so that the entire date range you require is highlighted green. Once all the required dates have been selected, click on the ‘Apply’ button. Please note that the dates you selected on this calendar were for the current year only. You will notice that the year selector has now become active. If the event runs on the same dates every year, you can repeat the procedure to select the dates for future years as required. Simply click on the year dropdown arrow selector and select the next year from the list that appears. Now repeat the procedure explained on the previous pages to specify the required dates for this year. Repeat these steps to select the dates for every year as required, click on the ‘Close’ button. You have now created your new ‘Calendar’ and you will be taken back to the bookings setup screen. Creating New ‘Time Slots’ Now you must create a ‘Time Slot’ for this event. A ‘Time Slot’ is set up to reflect your event times, which could be your opening times or a smaller time window as required. Please note this is not used in any way to refuse entry based on anyone coming outside the booking time, it is just the time that that booking will be recorded against in MStore. For the summer event scenario, we will set up a time slot to reflect the normal opening times (as 9 am to 5 pm). So, in this scenario you would set up a new ‘Time Slot’ to specify these times. Please note that you should first check to see if a suitable ‘Time Slot’ has already been created that can be used for your event. If not, then to create a new calendar then 1. click Setup then 2. click Bookings 3. then double click Time Slots. You will see a screen like the one showing below. Click on the ‘New’button (under file in the top left corner of the screen) At the next screen that appears, again click on the ‘New’button. Click in the ‘Code’ box and type in required code for this ‘Time Slot’. Click in ‘Description’ box and type in required description for this ‘Time Slot’. Once these have both been typed in, click on the ‘Apply’ button. Now click on the ‘Close’ button. You will now see a screen like the one below. Please note by default the time slots appear in hourly increments. If you want the time slot for this event to start on the half hour, then select the required ‘Time Scale:’ from this dropdown list (e.g. ‘30 min’). This will be required if e.g. your \"booking day\" runs from 9:30 am to 4:30 pm. Next you can use “click and drag” (as explained in Section 5) to select the required times. Click on the row representing the start time and drag the cursor to the row for the end time. The selected rows will now be highlighted yellow as shown below. With the rows highlighted yellow, now click in the ‘Description’ box. Type in a relevant ‘Description:’ for the time slot, e.g. ‘Summer Event Times’. Now click on the ‘Select’ button. The selected times for this ‘Time Slot’ will now be highlighted green displaying the description. Next click on the ‘Apply’ button and then ‘Close’. Creating New Bookable Resources In order to enter bookings using the MStore back office software, a ‘Bookable Resource’ needs to be set up for every item that can be booked. We will now create bookable resources using the PLU’s you created in Section 2. To create ‘Bookable Resources’, click on 1. Setup then 2. Bookings then double click on 3. Bookable Resources You will now see a screen like the one shown below. First you must select the type of bookable resource you wish to create from the PLU’s created earlier. To select the type of bookable resource you wish to create using the 'Resource Type' dropdown selector. Select the ‘Resource Type’ relevant to the bookable resource you are setting up. For example, if we are creating bookable resources for the PLU’s for admission ticket PLU’s that we created earlier, then under ‘Resource Type:’ you would select ‘Admission Ticket’. So, for our theoretical summer event we would need to set up bookable resources for the following: The PLU with the description “SUMMER EVENT ADULT ENTRY” (priced at £10.00). The PLU with the description “SUMMER EVENT SENIOR ENTRY” (priced at £8.00). The PLU with the description “SUMMER EVENT CHILD ENTRY” (priced at £4.00). The stock item with the description “SUMMER EVENT BASEBALL CAP”. ' First, we will cover how to set up 'Bookable Resources' for all the ‘Admission Ticket’ PLU’s. To set up 'Bookable Resources' for the admission ticket PLU’s, first you select the ‘Resource Type:’ you are going to set up . For all the admission ticket’ PLU’s, ensure that ‘Admission Ticket’ is picked in the 'Resource Type' dropdown. Next click on the ‘New’button. . The first bookable resource we need to set up is for the ‘Admission Ticket’ PLU with the description “SUMMER EVENT ADULT ENTRY”. The first step is to click the arrow to the right of 'Unit Price'. This will open the 'Prices Index' screen. Input the search criteria for the PLU. In this case the PLU code we created earlier was entered in 'Scan/Enter Code' field. Next click the ‘Search’ button. In the list of search results, click the PLU for this bookable resource (e.g. ‘SUMMER ADULT ENTRY’). The required PLU will be highlighted, now click the ‘Use Selected PLU’ button. You will now notice that the price of the selected PLU is now showing in the 'Unit Price' field The 'Code:' and 'Description:' fields have populated with that of from the PLU (if required these can be changed) Next, enter the ‘Number Available’. This is the quantity of this ‘Bookable Resource’ available per ‘Time Slot’ .If a limit is not required, you can enter ‘9999’ in this field (i.e. where no capacity management is needed). Alternatively if a capacity is needed for this specific ticket type, enter the number as required (e.g. 1000) Now click on the arrow next to ‘Dates Available’, this brings up a list of all ‘Calendar Periods’. From the list that appears, simply select the required ‘Calendar Period’ (as set up in Section 5). Important note: do not select the calendar ‘Whole Year’. Select one of the bespoke 'Calendar Periods' you have created. In this example we will select the calendar period called “Summer Events”. There are now several options here which you need to select or de-select as required. ‘Show on Diary:’ Click the box to the right of the text ‘Show on Diary’ so that it is tickedif you want this bookable resource to appear on the MStore back office software ‘Diary’ screen (see section 9) when it's booked. ‘Print Times on Documents:’ Click the box to the right of the text ‘Print Times on Documents’ so it is tickedif you want the time that this resource was booked for to to be included on the default 'Booking Confirmation' letter (report) that is provided with MStore. this can be run as a report or can be provided. This can be run as a report (Report Bookings > Booking Confirmation) or is generated after opening a booking record by (1) clicking the 'Print' button in a booking, or (ii) is used to generate the attachment when clicking the the 'Email Conf' button (that can email a booking confirmation by Outlook - if your company have installed this. ‘Print Values on Documents:’ This is the same as the above, except it adds the time in the same way to the relevant documents. ‘Allow Booking from Internet:’ This setting only applies if you have purchased K3's online ticketing module. If not then simply leave this setting un-ticked, as it is not applicable. Click the box to the right of the text ‘Allow Booking from Internet’ so that it is ticked only if you want customers to be able to book this resource on your bookings website. Only applies to customers who have purchased the Online Ticketing Module (e-commerce web pages) from K3. ‘Named Tickets?:’ This is only for online bookings and is usually only used for birthday party bookings, when you need to record the name of the person the birthday party is for in the booking in MStore. Having this option selected means that when you book this resource online, a box appears in which you can enter a person’s name. To select this option, click the box to the right of the text ‘Named Tickets’ so that it is ticked .N.B. this name is not printed on tickets produced at the till (if applicable) when redeeming the booking. Part Payment (Online): This setting only applies if you have purchased K3's online ticketing module. Part payment can be set on each 'Bookable Resource' as required to allow part payment when the resource is booked on-line only. Part payment can be set as either percentage of the item price or a specific amount as required. ‘Edit Booking Letter’ Button’ N.B. if you want to create your own booking letters in Microsoft Word then do not use this option. If you do not how to set up and use Microsoft Word mail merge templates in the MStore, then this would require chargeable training. Please contact your Customer Success Account Manager and they will be able to provide a quote for your training needs. This option is only used if you want to use MStore's pre-defined single 'Booking Confirmation' letter (report) that is supplied with the MStore back office software and can be sent to a customer form within a booking record or run as a report (in Reports Bookings > Booking Confirmation report). If so, then you can add some additional text but only to specific sections of this letter by clicking on the ‘Edit Booking Letter’ button then you will see screen below. Please note you can only add text to three sections of this predefined MStore 'Booking Confirmation' letter letter as follows: Please note you cannot amened the font size, style, or colour, as this is predefined. Simply type in text as required in each section, then click on the ‘Ok’ button to accept the changes. Next under the text ‘Times Available’ use the dropdown to select the required ‘Time Slot’ created (see Section 6). Important note – do not ever select the time slot ‘Whole Day’. Always use a bespoke ‘Time Slot’ you have created. Please note if different times were offered on different days of the week then you could create multiple ‘Time Slots’ as required. For Example you could have a 'Summer Event Weekday' and a 'Summer Event Weekend' ‘Time Slot’. You can then pick the ‘Time Slot’ to use for each different day of the week by clicking in the box to the left of the text 'Always' (under 'Times Available', so that that the tick in this box disappears. The selected ‘Time Slot’ will now appear in every day of the week (see below screenshot). Then use the dropdown selector (to the right of each named day) to select the required ‘Time Slot’ for that day (e.g. either the 'Summer Event Weekday' and a 'Summer Event Weekend' ‘Time Slot’ as applicable) If there are specific days of the week in which this resource cannot be booked, simply click in the box to the left of the relevant day so the box becomes un-ticked. Once the 'Time Slot'(s) have been selected / deselected as required, click on the ‘Apply’ button. You have now set up this bookable resource and you will be back at the screen shown below. Now you would repeat the steps detailed in the previous pages to set up all the other 'Bookable Resources' that are required. Remember you must first select the correct ‘Resource Type’. So, for our theoretical event we need to set up: 'Bookable Resources' with the ‘Resource Type’ of 'Admission ticket’ for: The ‘Admission Ticket’ PLU with the description “SUMMER EVENT ADULT ENTRY” (priced at £10.00). The ‘Admission Ticket’ PLU with the description “SUMMER EVENT CHILD ENTRY” (priced at £5.00). The ‘Admission Ticket’ PLU with the description “SUMMER EVENT SENIOR ENTRY” (priced at £7.50). 'Bookable Resources' with the ‘Resource Type’ of 'Stocked Item’ for: A ‘Stocked Item’ PLU with the description “Summer Event Baseball Cap” (priced at £10.00). After selecting the relevant ‘Resource Type’, then you would simply click on the ‘New’ button and set up all the other bookable resources in exactly the same way as the example detailed on the previous pages. Each type of bookable resource is explained below, so that you can choose the required type: Admission Ticket: Select this option for PLU’s set in the wizard as ‘Admission Ticket’ PLU’s. Hire Item: Select this option for PLU’s set in the wizard as ‘Hire Item PLU’s. For example, you may create a PLU called “Bike Hire” that you want to create a bookable resource from. Location: Select this option for PLU’s set up in the wizard for specific locations that you want to create a bookable resource from (locations would usually be set up as either a ‘Bookable Item’, or ‘Hire Item’ type PLU). For example, you may create a PLU called “Function Room” that you want to create a bookable resource from. Tour/Session: This only applies to PLU’S which are linked to Sessions and is not covered in this manual, there is a separate guide on this topic. For your information sessions are (i) when a resource can be booked for a specific time increment. For example there may sessions running every half hour for a specified activity, the first ‘session’ is at 9:00-9:30 am, the second session is at 9:30-10:00 am etc. (ii) For each ‘session’ there is also a maximum availability, for example the 9:00-9:30 am session has an availability of 10 people only etc. (iii) and also multiple different ticket types can make up the session capacity (e.g. the 10 capacity can be a combination of e.g. adult, child and concession tickets). Non Stocked Item: Select this option for PLU’s set in the wizard as ‘Non-Stocked Item’ PLU’s. Person: Select this option for PLU’s set up in the wizard for specific people that you want to create a bookable resource from, people would usually be set up as either a ‘Bookable Item’, or ‘Hire Item’ type PLU. For example, you may create a PLU called “Tour Guide” that you want to create a bookable resource from. Stocked Item: Select this option for PLU’s set in the wizard as ‘Stocked Item’ PLU’s. Adding / Editing Booking Templates To create a new ‘Booking Template’ 1. click ‘Setup’ 2. click ‘Bookings’. 3. double click ‘Booking Templates’. To start creating a new booking ‘Booking Template’, click on the ‘New’button. . Type in the required name for the template in the ‘Template Name’ box (e.g. “Summer Event”). Now select the ‘Booking Type’, click on the dropdown arrow here to display the list of options. Please note these categories are a user definable list and can be set up in Setup > System> Lookup Items. Most Booking Reports can be filtered by this 'Booking Type'. There is also the ability to extract customer data that made booking in a specific 'Booking type' which can be exported to Excel or used to create Mail Merges to Word directly form MStore. This is covered in a separate guide on 'Member Mailing' In ‘Dated/Undated’: Select as required from the available options described below: ‘Open Dated Tickets’: Select this for “Open Dated” bookings, where bookings are not for a specific date. The customer can come in (redeem the booking at the till) on any date they like. ‘Date Specified Booking’: Select this if a booking must be allocated to a specific date. The customer must specify the date they are coming at the time of booking. The customer is expected to come in (redeem the booking at the till) the date they booked for. The till system will warn you if they come in before / after this date. You then decide based on your policies whether to allow entry or e.g. ask them buy day tickets. In this example we have selected the ‘Date Specified Booking’ option. Next you must select the required ‘Template Style’. In ‘Template Style’ select the required option from the drop-down list here. Tickets: This ‘Template Style’ for templates is typically used where there are no capacity management requirements for a specific 'Bookable Resource', so there is no limit on the quantity of a specific ticket type. Typically the this is where the 'Bookable Resource' setting of 'Number Available' would be set to 9999 (as there is no concept of infinity / unlimited in MStore a number needs to be entered). Please note: if this ‘Template Style’ is used and a 'Bookable Resource' setting of 'Number Available' is set to a specific quantity (e.g. 1000) it will allow that quantity (1000) to be booked quantity per booking. Availability/Groups: This is where you want to manage the capacity of a specific resource to a total number per 'Timeslot'. If this ‘Template Style’ is used it will manage the total quantity that can be booked per 'Timeslot' to the quantity entered in the 'Number Available' setting of each 'Bookable Resource'. So, if the 'Number Available' of a generic 'Event Ticket' has the 'Number Available' set as 2000 on 'Bookable Resource', this would only allow 2000 in total of this specific ticket to be booked into that 'Timeslot' (which is set to be the duration of the event e.g. a 9:00am-5:00pm or as required). Please note: if an event has multiple times per day it can run, then generally Sessions will need to be used. Sessions/Tours: This ‘Template Style’ style must be selected when bookable resources for sessions will be contained in the template. Please note setting up sessions are not included in the scope of this manual. Birthday Parties: Select this ‘Template Style’ for birthday party bookings, as this will give you the option to record the name of the person whose birthday it is when making a booking using this template. The other options should NOT be used to set up non session based booking, so should NOT be selected. In this example we have selected the ‘Availability/Groups’ for the ‘Template Style’. Once all the required information has been selected as required then click on the ‘Save’ button. Now you must select the ‘Bookable Resources’ that will be used in this template. To do this click on the ‘Add >>’ button (at the bottom of the section of the screen labelled 'Resources) You will now see ‘Select Booking Resources’ screen (as shown below). The next step is to select the required bookable resources. At the start it is quite easy to find any 'Bookable Resources' you have created as only the few set up will appear. Over time once you have added lots of 'Bookable Resources', so the best way to find specific ones is to enter the code or part of the code or description in the 'Filter' field. Please note that no % wildcard is needed as the filter searches automatically for anything containing the code / description entered. In this example 1. SUMMER was entered in the 'Filter' field was entered, then 2. the 'Apply' button was clicked to show the results, 3. To select the required 'Bookable Resources click the box next to them, so that a tick appears in the required boxes. 4. Once all the required bookable resources have been selected click on the ‘Ok’ button. You will now see the 'Bookable Resources' that you selected here listed in the 'Resources' section of the screen. Please note the order the resources appear in this list can be changed by clicking on a 'Bookable Resource' so that it is highlighted yellow. Next click the up / down arrows as required to move the resource up / down the list. This will affect the position of the resource in the list of resources when making an in house booking. This also applies to online bookings for those customers that have purchased the module and set up this 'Booking Template' to work online. Click the 'Save' button once the required changes have been made. In the 'Booking Template' there are other options that can be applied to each 'Bookable Resource', but these settings are only applicable for customers who have purchased the ‘Online Bookings Module’ from K3. these settings are only designed to work with our Online Ticketing (E-Commerce) Module for those customers who have require the K3 online ticketing e-commerce web page pages. These online ticketing web page specific settings are covered in Section 10. For customers that have not purchased the Online Ticketing Module from K3, then all of these settings are not applicable. In this case please ignore all other settings as they do not apply to \"in-house\" (back office software or till based) bookings! Confirmation Letter For each ‘Booking Template’ you create, you can specify a ‘Confirmation Letter’. This letter will be printed automatically but only when a booking is made \"in house\" (till or back office software) using the booking ‘Wizard’ (and selecting a 'Booking Template that has been assigned a ‘Confirmation Letter’ - see Section 9). Please note that the ‘Confirmation Letter’ itself has to first be created in Microsoft Word as a mail merge template, this is covered in a separate user guide. Alternatively, training on this functionality can be provide and if this is required please contact your Customer Success Manager and they will be able to provide a quote for your training needs. If you already know how to and have set up a Microsoft Word mail merge template(s) to be used for your ‘Confirmation Letter’, then you simply click on the ... button to the right of the text 'Confirmation Letter:'. Browse to the required location and click on the required booking confirmation letter, so it is highlighted. Next click on ‘Open’ to select this letter. You have now assigned a ‘Confirmation Letter’ to this booking template, which is showing here. Once you have selected the required ‘Confirmation Letter’ then click on the ‘Save’ button. If you do not require a ‘Confirmation Letter’ then don’t select one and just click on the ‘Save’ button. Please note that there are various other the settings that only apply to customers who have (i) purchased the MStore ‘Online Bookings Module’ from K3 and (ii) only for booking templates that will be used for online bookings on your web site. All these additional settings are are explained in detail in Section 10. Finally click on the ‘Close’ button to exit the ‘Booking Templates’ screen. You have now created a booking template called ‘SUMMER EVENT’. You now must test this new Booking Template works correctly, which is detailed in Section 9. Creating New Bookings The template you created will now be available to use in the booking ‘Wizard’ screen. The booking ‘Wizard’ is the simplest way to make new bookings. Although we are using the ‘Wizard’ to test our new ‘Booking Template’, exactly the same procedure can be used to make new bookings using the ‘Wizard’. Using the Booking Wizard The booking ‘Wizard’ screen is accessed by first clicking on the ‘Diary’ main menu button. The ‘Wizard’ is then accessed by clicking on the ‘Wizard’ button here. At the next screen you are required to select the date for the booking from the calendar. Please note for whatever is being booked you will need to select a date is was set to be available on. This is defined by the 'Calendar Period' you set up which was then applied to the specific 'Bookable Resources' This means only you can only book specific 'Bookable Resources' if the 'Calendar Period' they are assigned to includes the booking date. If the system does not allow you to book check the 'Calendar Period' for each 'Bookable Resource'. Also check (in Setup > Prices > Price Lookup Index) that the there is a valid price for the PLU that the 'Bookable Resource' is linked to. If the date of the booking is in the current month, simply click on the required date to select it. However this is a 'Summer Event' which only runs on specific summer dates. If the booking is for a future month, click on the text for the month name (e.g. click on 'March' at the top of the screen) You will then see a list of months appear, click on the required month to select it from the list. If the booking is for the next year, then click on the year text (e.g. click on '2025' at the top of the calendar). You will then see an up and down arrow selector appear to the right of the year. Use the up and down arrow to select the year as required. Then select the month and date of the booking as explained above, in this case Saturday 5th July 2025 was selected. Once the required date for the booking has been selected, click on the ‘Next’ button. You will now see a screen like the one below. All the templates have been created, they will all be listed on the left hand side. Click on the name of the 'Booking Template' on the left hand side of the screen (e.g. \"Summer Event\") so it highlighted (blue). N.B. you only have only created one template it will be selected (highlighted) automatically. When you click on the required 'Booking Template' name the resources that you added to that template will be shown. These appear under the 'Select Items to Book' text and will all be ticked (selected) by default. If in this booking you do not require specific resources, these can be de-selected as required. Click on the to the right of bookable resource to deselect it. A will now appear to the right of the resource, indicating it is deselected. You can toggle between selected and de-selected as required by clicking on the or button. If there were a lot of resources in the template it is sometimes easier to deselect them all first, then select them one at a time. To do this click the 'Toggle All Off' button. Then use the method above to select / deselect 'Bookable Resources' as required. Ensure the required 'Bookable Resources' for this booking have a showing to the right of them. Click on the ‘Next’ button. Next you must specify the quantity of the resource you want to book. To do this type in the ‘Number to Book’ in the relevant field, then click on the ‘Next’ button. Repeat the procedure for the next resource(s). So, enter the ‘Number to Book’ for each resource in the booking, then click on the ‘Next’ button. If multiple resources were selected and a specific resource is not needed it can just be skipped by clicking 'Next' Once the quantity of each resource in the booking has been specified, the below screen appears. It is recommended to always search for the customer to see if they have booked before, to avoid duplication 1. To see If the customer making the booking already exists, type in their surname in the 'Name' field.. To limit results it is recommended to type in their surname, then a comma then their initial or full first name. 2. Now press on the ‘Search’ button and the search results are displayed. 3. Click on the required customer, so they become highlighted. 4. Now click on the ‘Next’ button. Alternatively, if this person may be a new customer that does not exist in the MStore back office software. In this case enter their surname and click search (just to check), then as no results are found simply click on the ‘Next’ button. In the next screen you must then enter all the required information into the ‘Contact Details’ screen below. The above fields are self-explanatory, so simply click in the relevant box and enter the contact details. If a (*) to the left of a box means it you must put an entry in this box as this data is mandatory. Please note there is some control over what can be set as mandatory in Setup >System > System Options > 'Bookings' tab. The other settings that can be applied to a customer in this form are explained below. ‘Account Type’: Select the required ‘Account Type’ from the available list. There is also the ability to search for, extract lists of customers and create mail merges to customers which have an 'Account Type' selected. The use of the mail merge / 'Member Mailing' functionality is not covered in the scope of this manual. This is covered in a separate user guide. ‘Account Source’: Select the required ‘Account Source’ from the available list. ‘Account Flags’: Select the required ‘Account Flag’ from the available list. There is also the ability to search for, extract lists of customers and create mail merges to customers which have 'Account Flags' selected. The use of the mail merge / 'Member Mailing' functionality is not covered in the scope of this manual. This is covered in a separate user guide. For customers without the GDPR module there will also be in this screen the options: ‘Ok to Mail’: Please note that if you have purchased the MStore ‘GDPR Module’ then this tick box is not applicable as it will not be present. If you do not have the ‘GDPR Module’, then tick this option if you have confirmed it is OK to contact a customer via mail. There is the ability elsewhere in the software to search for, extract lists of members and create mail merges to customers which have this option ticked. The use of the mail merge ('Member Mailing' functionality is not covered in the scope of this manual. This is covered in a separate user guide. ‘Ok to Email’: Please note that if you have purchased the MStore ‘GDPR Module’ then this tick box is not applicable as it will not be present. If you do not have the ‘GDPR Module’, then tick this option if you have confirmed it is OK to contact a customer via email. There is the ability elsewhere in the software to search for, extract lists of members and create mail merges to customers which have this option ticked. The use of the mail merge ('Member Mailing' functionality is not covered in the scope of this manual. This is covered in a separate user guide. If you want more information on the GDPR module then please contact your Customer Success Manager and they will be able to provide a quote for the functionality and your training needs.* Once all the required information has been entered, then click on the ‘Next’ button. The next screen will be the GDPR options (please see the above* if you need a quote or information on the GDPR module) Select the GDPR options as required in each section, alternatively click the 'Do not make any contact option' to opt out. You will now see all the overview of the booking, with the customer details showing in the top left corner of this screen. Below that will be the booking date and 'Arrival Time' selector. If the customer is due to arrive at a different time to their booking their arrival time can be captured. For example, it may be a coach party who want to go to the restaurant at 8:00 am for breakfast and this field allows you to capture an arrival time if different to the time of the booked tickets / activities. Click on the hour and either use the up/down arrow or click in the hours and enter the hour in 24 hour clock 'hh' format. Do the same to amend the minutes (if typing the minutes do this in 'mm' format) as required. The arrival time will be shown in the relevant reports and will be recoded in the specific booking record in MStore. Enter 'Notes' as required in the notes field, e.g. to reflect that they are arriving at 08:00 to go to the restaurant etc. For birthday party booking, if you wish to enter their name and date of birth, then click thenext to 'Birthday Party?' If required, you can then capture the name of the person with the birthday and their date of birth where shown. In the 'Name' field enter name of the person whose birthday it is and select their date of birth using the 'DOB:' dropdown. If the birthday party name and date is not needed, click on the to turn this function off again. Finally click on the ‘Booking Source’ dropdown and select the required option using the dropdown. This is to capture the \"source\" of the booking which could be e.g. 'Phone Booking'. MStore provides some basic option but these are user-definable and are created / maintained by you in MStore. This can be done in Setup > System > Lookup Items and is covered in a separate guide. As you are testing this as long as you can get to this point you do not need click on the ‘Finish’ button. Doing this will create the booking, so you would then need to cancel any test bookings made. Once this template is working as required, then you can use this template to create new bookings. If you assigned a 'Confirmation Letter' to this booking template, then it is option whether it needs to be printed. Please note printing booking confirmation letters requires your IT Team to have installed Microsoft Word on your computer. By default the 'Print Confirmation Letter?' option is ticked. If it doesn't need to be printed, click theto turn this off. Thethen turns to a. The functionality can be toggled on / off as required by click theor. If you do NOT want to create a test booking as this point click the 'Cancel' button. If you DO want to create a test booking as this point click the ‘Finish’ button to create the booking. If you click the ‘Finish’ button you will then see a window confirming the booking was saved (as shown below). Please note that this contains the customer’s booking reference number. If you selected a confirmation letter, Microsoft Word will automatically open in the background. The booking details will be merged into the a Word document (using the 'Confirmation Letter' Word document template assigned to the 'Booking Template'). Please note K3 do not provide training or Support on the Microsoft Word or it's mail merge functionality. So, once Word has opened and created the document, you would need the relevant training to be able to preview / complete the mail merge using Microsoft Word to print (save soft copies or merge and email) of the document. Your IT team will need to have installed Microsoft Word and they may also need to amend Word's own 'Trustcenter' settings that can block third party applications (like MStore) from being able to open Word. This will need to be done on each computer that uses mail merging to Word via MStore. If your IT cannot resolve any mail merging issues experienced, then please log a ticket with K3 Support via the K3 Support Portal. Click on the ‘OK’ button, which takes you back to the ‘Diary’ screen as shown below. Internet Bookings Setup As stated previously to be able to use booking templates for internet bookings on your website you must have first purchased web site integration from K3. You must also ensure that the specific booking templates that will be used for online bookings on your web site must have the ‘Allow From Internet’ setting selected. To do this go into ‘Booking Templates’ screen. 1. Click on the required template name so it is highlighted. 2. Now click in the ‘Allow From Internet’ box, so that it is ticked. 3. As soon as you select this option you will now notice that the ‘Website URL:’ field is automatically populated. N.B. once you have done all the tests to check all is working as expected, this is the web page address (URL) you must provide to the person who designs and maintains your own web site, so they can add this link on your website where required. 4. Click 'Save' to accept the changes at this point. Please note that no one can see this web page as this point it only exists in the MStore back office. It can be viewed and tested via the MStore back office software, this is covered below. It will only be available to book from your own web pages once your web developer puts this specific page URL where required on your own web pages, after you have done full end-end testing. The below additional settings also only apply to 'Booking Templates' that are set up to be used online. There are both 1. settings that can be applied to each specific 'Bookable Resource' as required and also in 2. and 3. settings that can be applied that affect the entire 'Booking Template' (web page) when used online. Each of these sections of the screen are detail below Resource Specific Settings These settings are in section 1 of the above screenshot. These are set per 'Bookable Resource' (each ticket type can have different settings). These are detailed below. Min per booking: This stands for “minimum per booking”. This enables you to define the minimum number of this resource that can be booked per booking. For example, if this resource was for a group admission ticket that can only be booked for parties of more than 10 people, then enter 10 in this box. N.B. if there is no minimum booking requirement, then leave a 0 in this box. Must book at least one of these Select this option against a bookable resource to ensure at least one of this resource must be booked. For example, this could be selected against the resource for an adult admission ticket, to ensure at least one adult admission ticket must be booked. To select this option, click in the box to the right of the relevant text so that is becomes ticked Max per booking: This stands for “maximum per booking”. This enables you to define the maximum number of this resource that can be booked per booking. For example, if this bookable resource was for a special event ticket and you want to limit people to book only 5 of this bookable resource per booking, then enter the number 5 in this box. N.B. if there is no minimum booking requirement, then leave a 0 in this box. Named tickets? This is only for online bookings and is usually only used for birthday party bookings, when you need to record the name of the person the birthday party is for in the booking in MStore only. N.B. this name is not printed on tickets produced at the till (if applicable) when redeeming the booking. Having this option selected means that when you book this resource online, a box appears in which you can enter a person’s name. To select this option, click the box to the right of the text ‘Named Tickets’ so that it is ticked . Exclude Resource from Location-Master: This setting is not required used – please do not use this setting. Cannot be sold alone: Select this option against a bookable resource to prevent it being booked alone. For example, this may be used if we want to ensure that when booking children’s admission tickets that a responsible adult must also be booked. In our specific example we may select this on the ‘Summer Child’ resource, this will ensure either that at least one ‘Summer Adult’ or ‘Summer Senior’ resource must be booked first. To select this option, click in the box to the right of the relevant text so that is becomes ticked. Require Member Validation: This is only used where the memberships system has been set up and is in use. If needed specific ticket types (usually ones at special day / event ticket prices for members) can be set up so that they can only be booked if a valid membership card number is provided when booking online. To set this up the 'Require Member Validation' option needs to be ticked for each resource it is required on. Once ticked then the 'Choose Memb Types' button becomes active and needs to be clicked. A pop-up then appears in which you can click on the 'Membership types' that are allowed to validate that ticket type. Selected membership types show highlighted (blue). Once all membership types are selected in this screen, click 'Save'. Repeat for any other ticket types that require validation. Validation online will be by entering a valid (non expired) member card number of the specified membership type(s). Essential Items (internet only): Specific 'Bookable Resources' can be set to be \"essential\" in order for a booking to be able to be made. If the correct number of these resources are not selected then you cannot complete the booking, the customer will be prompted online if they try and pay without selecting pre-requisite resources. If certain tickets are deemed \"essential\" then each of the 'Bookable Resources' resource that counts as an \"essential item\" needs to be ticked where shown below. This then works in conjunction with one of the settings that is set at 'Booking Template' level (see below *) Booking Template Specific Settings These are some other settings that can be set on each booking template. Allow from Internet: Already explained previously in this guide. Use Location Master This setting is not required used – please do not use this setting. Hide Location Master from Basket This setting is not required used – please do not use this setting. Web follow on Template ID: This option is only applicable once you have created more than one online booking template in the MStore back office software. After a specific booking template is used online, rather than going directly to the payment screen you can automatically be directed to another K3 online booking template (web page). This is known as a web follow on template. For example, if you want the ‘Summer Event’ Template to be automatically directed to another template, you simply enter the ID number of the other template in the ‘Web follow on template ID’ field then click ‘Save'. Please note the ID of a template can be found by clicking on it so it is highlighted and then noting the ID number, where shown below. Create Sales Order for Dispatching This setting is not typically required for online templates that are used to sell admission tickets online. If ticked, when booked online a 'Sales Order' will be created in the relevant screen in MStore. This is typically only used / required for online shop or online membership purchases (for those customers who have purchased these modules) where shop items needs to be picked and marked as dispatched. Some customers use this to ensure member cards / packs are dispatched. Essential Items (Internet Only ): After you have ticked each specific 'Bookable Resource' *see above *) that counts to the number of \"essential items\" in total, then where shown you need to specific the total number \"essential items\" that need to be booked. If the correct number of \"essential items\" are not selected, the customer will be prompted and cannot book until the requirements are met. In the below box you simply enter the total number of \"essential items\" that need to be purchased, this is in any combination. So if you need at least one person over 18 to book, then you might e.g. tick the 'Summer Event Adult Entry' and 'Summer Event Senior Entry' tickets only as \"Essential Items\", then enter the number where shown below to be 1. Max Per Template (Internet Only) If you need to restrict the total number of resources booked per booking to X then enter the required number in this field. Web Page Header and Trailer Text / HTML This is also set per 'Booking Template' or web page. You can create your own bespoke header and footer sections per 'Booking Template'. This is often used for extra instructional text on the event or e.g. how to book. HTML Header: You can enter your own text that will appear in the header section of the web page for this specific booking template, this is known as the ‘HTML header’. If you do not require any additional text in the web page header, then please ignore this option. If required, you can define you own ‘HTML Header’ by clicking on the ‘Edit’ button to the right of the ‘HTML header’ text. Likewise the HTML trailer is accessed and created / updated by clicking the relevant 'Edit' button. If required, this allows you to create in either text or HTML (if you know HTML) to add a bespoke web page header or trailer. This is often used to add instructions text about the event, booking requirements or e.g. extra instructions on what to do on the web page to book. Clicking either button opens a screen like the one shown below. For users that do not know HTML, you simply type the required text here (maximum of 4000 characters in total). Please note that unless know how to write HTML. you cannot change the font type size and formatting etc. iAlternatively, for users who know how to use HTML, then you can type in the required HTML (maximum of 4000 characters in total). So, this may be something that (if required) your own web page developer or in-house HTML experts can assist with. Click on ‘Ok’ once the required web page header text has been entered as required. HTML Trailer: This is accessed and edited (if required) in the same was as the 'HTML Header' as detailed above. HTML Layout: This is only to be used by K3 – do not enter anything in the ‘HTML Layout’ unless advised to by K3. Once all the settings have been selected as required for this template, click on the ‘Save’ button.

You will now be on the ‘Admin Menu’ page, click on the ‘Update Templates’ button. Wait for the ’Update completed successfully’ message. Once this procedure has finished, you can then press the ‘Logout’ button which is located at he bottom of this screen. You can now check how any of your booking templates will appear online. To do this click on the required online booking template so it’s highlighted. Now click on the ‘View’ button, this will open the ‘Website URL’ (see section 10) shown here. Now it is your responsibility to check the page created functions as required. If the web page does not function as expected, you must check that everything was set up correctly. Please refer to all the previous sections of this manual to check the set up was carried out correctly.. Please note it is also your responsibility to speak to your own web designer and provide them with this new ‘Website URL’ and advise them as to where this needs to be used on your own website page(s). You now know how to set up and test online ‘Booking Templates’.",

The MStore back office software has the facility to set up ‘Sessions’ to cater for exactly this scenario. Sessions are events that must have a location, leader, time and a capacity (per session time). The main benefits and also some examples of typical ‘Sessions’ are outlined below: The session capacity (e.g. 1000 total) can be made of multiple PLU’s (admission tickets). For example, a concert of 1000 capacity can be made up of adult, child, or concession PLU’s. The same ‘Session Type’ can happen in multiple locations. For example, the ‘Santa’s Grotto’ session might happen in both the ‘Garden Centre’ and the ‘House’. The same session type can happen at multiple times in a day. For example, the Santa’s Grotto ‘Session’ runs every 15 minutes from 9:00 am until 4:00 pm. (each 15 minute session can have the same, or a different capacity as necessary). If required, each session can be assigned the person (‘leader’) that is responsible for managing / running that session, so that you can see at a glance the staff member, or external person running each session. Setting Up Sessions Creating ‘Session Types’ ‘Session Types’ are often thought of as the type of activity i.e. guided tour, outdoor theatre, ice skating. These could be for anything where strict capacity management is required to a quantity of total tickets (across multiple ticket types) per time. To create new ‘Session Types’ 1. click Setup then 2. click System, then 3. double click Lookup Items. In the ‘Lookup Items’ window, click on the dropdown next to ‘Lookup Group:’ and select ‘Session Types’. Create a new ‘Session Type’ click on the ‘New’button that is located in the top left corner of the screen. Next enter a ‘Code’ and ‘Description’ for the new ‘Session Type’ and click ‘Apply’. A new ‘Session Type’ has now been created. Repeat the above steps if more ‘Session Types’ are required, otherwise click on ‘Close’. Creating ‘Session / Tour Leaders’ Once the ‘Session Types’ have been set up, the next stage is to set up the ‘Session/Tour Leaders’. This is the person that will lead the tour or session. If these are not required, create one e.g. called ‘N/A’. This is because the system requires a ‘Session/Tour Leaders’ to be assigned to each session you set-up To create a new ‘Session/Tour Leaders’ : 1. click Setup then 2. click System then 3. double click on ‘Lookup Items’. In the ‘Lookup Items’ window, click on the ‘Lookup Group:’ dropdown and select ‘Session/Tour Leaders’. Create a new record by clicking on the ‘New’button, located in the top left corner of the screen Next enter a ‘Code’ and ‘Description’ as required and click ‘Apply’. This has now created a new ‘Session / Tour Leader’. Repeat the above steps if more ‘Session/Tour Leaders’ are required, otherwise click on 'Close'. Creating ‘Session Locations’ Your attraction may have several different locations where events, sessions or tours can take place. To create new ‘Session Locations’: 1. click on Setup then 2. click on System then 3. double click on Session Locations When you create a new ‘Session Location’ the system needs to know what ‘Session Types’ can take place in that location. Create a new ‘Session Location’ by clicking on the ‘New’button, located in the top left corner of the screen. Enter the ‘Code’ and ‘Description’ for this Session Location’ by filling in the relevant boxes. The ‘Display Sequence’ box is only relevant for customers who are using ‘Timelines’ till layouts. For those that use ‘Timelines’ till layouts, the ‘Display Sequence’ is the order in which these ‘Session Locations’ appear on the ‘Timelines’ till display. This sequence can be set per till as required. If you are not using ‘Timelines’ till layouts, please ignore this setting. This number automatically defaults to the next number in the sequence, so no action is necessary. Setting up and using ‘Timelines’ till layouts, it outside of the scope of this manual, so if you require any training / consultancy on this functionality, please contact your Customer Success Account Manager for more information and a quote. The final step is to select the ‘Session Types’ that can take place in this Location. This is done by clicking in the box next to the ‘Session Type’ required, so that it becomes ticked (under the heading ‘Applicable to Session Types’). It is possible to select more than one ‘Session Type’ per ‘Session Location’, e.g. a Location of ‘Main Garden’ could have ‘Outdoor Theatre’, ‘Movie Nights’ and ‘Garden Parties’. Click on as many of the ‘Session Types’ as required, so the required ones become ticked for that location. Click on ‘Save’ and a new ‘Session Location’ has now been created. Repeat the above steps if more ‘Session Locations’ are required, otherwise click on ‘Close’. Creating ‘Sessions/Tours’ Once the required ‘Session Type’, ‘Session Location’ and ‘Session/Tour Leader’ have been created (as detailed above), the new ‘Session/Tours’ can be added. To create a new Session 1. click Setup then 2. click Bookings then 3. double click on Sessions/Tours. Now, select the date of the first session using the ‘Session/Tour Date’ dropdown. Pick the required date from the calendar. You can use the left / right arrows to go back / forward a month. Alternatively click on the month text (e.g. click on the text 'March') to bring up a month selector pop-up and click the month. If you click the year text (e.g. click on '2025') up and down arrows appear which can be used to select the required year. 1. You will now see the selected date showing here 2. Next click the ‘Location’ dropdown selector and 3. select the required 'Session Location' (e.g. 'Santa's Grotto') When the ‘Session/Tour Date’ and ‘Location’ have been selected, click the ‘New’button (in the top left corner) A new (blank) session record has been created and you will now need to enter the required data. First select the required ‘Session Type’ from the relevant dropdown selector. The selected session type will then show in the ‘Session Type’ field. Now select the required session ‘Leader’ from the relevant dropdown selector. If there is no requirement to record a 'Session Leader' create a session leader called e.g. 'Not Required' and select this leader. Enter the session start time in the ‘Time’ box using the 24-hour clock format. For example, 9:00 am needs to be entered as 0900. Note: No punctuation is required, just enter the figures as the colon (:) is entered automatically. Enter the session end time in the ‘to’ box using the 24-hour clock format (e.g. 9:30 am needs to be entered as 0930) Please note the ‘Description’ box defaults to the same as the ‘Session Type’. Amend this ‘Description’ (if required) by typing in the relevant box marked ‘Description’. If required this 'Description' can be shown online instead of the name of the 'Session Type' Please note the tick box options 'Allow Session to appear on Kiosk' and 'Kiosk Description' are only used for customers who have purchased our 'Kiosk' solutions. These do not need to be selected / populated for any other customers. Now specify the following criteria for the session: ‘Min’: Enter the minimum number of people that can be booked onto this session. (N.B. this is usually set to ‘0’ to specify there is no minimum requirement). In some scenarios, however, you may wish to specify a minimum number of people that must book onto a session. If so, just enter the required minimum figure in the ‘Min’ box (e.g. 20). An example may be when lectures or talks are offered to schools and you want to specify you can only book a minimum number of people onto a session. Please note this is for information only, the \"in house\" system will not restrict the minimum required number to this quantity, this will need to be policed by the staff taking these bookings. Online settings can be put in place to restrict this minimum number automatically, these settings are detailed later. ‘Max:’ Enter the maximum number of people than can be booked onto this session as required. This will be enforced automatically. ‘Warn At’: When making a booking in the back-office software, a warning can be displayed when the session is approaching capacity. When clicking in this box, it automatically populates with the figure in the ‘Max’ box. However, this number can be altered according to requirements. For instance, a session set up for a concert with a maximum capacity of 200, may require a warning when the number booked exceeds 180. The required number of 180 would be entered in the ‘Warn At:’ box. ‘Allow Session to appear on Internet’: This is only selected (by clicking the box) if this specific session will be sold online. If it is unticked this session will only be bookable \"in house\". Please refer to the ‘Setting Up Online Session Bookings’ section of the manual for more information. ‘Of Which avail For Internet’: A number can be entered in this box to limit the total number of places that can be booked online. This can be used to essentially \"reserve\" some of the capacity, so it can only be booked \"in house\" (e.g. for phone based / till bookings), or sold as \"walk up\" tickets at the till (by selling the same PLUs at the till on a till button where no booking is made). Please refer to the ‘Setting Up Online Session Bookings’ section of this guide for more information on the internet-specific configuration. Event (show in Event Wizard) In the till and back office there is a Session specific booking tool called the 'Event Wizard'. For sessions to be bookable in the till / back office software using the 'Event Wizard' then click the ‘Event (show in Event Wizard)’ box, so it is ticked. Now specify the remaining criteria for the session: ‘Default PLU’: This functionality is not required (it is for bespoke functionality created for a specific customer). ‘Seating Plan’: This is only required where a ‘Seating Plan’ is used. This is not covered in the scope of this manual ‘Release Seats’ button: This is only required where a ‘Seating Plan’ is used. This is not covered in the scope of this manual. ‘Seats Allocation’ button: This is only required where a ‘Seating Plan’ is used. This is not covered in the scope of this manual. ‘Make Booking’ button: This functionality is not required (it is for bespoke functionality created for a specific customer). ‘Session Status’: There are three different options for the ‘Session Status’, as explained below: ‘Available’: By default, any new session will be marked as ‘Available’, allowing it to be booked once set up. ‘Not Available’: If a session must not be available for booking immediately, then select ‘Not Available’ by clicking on this option. Please note, once the ‘Not Available’ option has been selected, to make the relevant session(s) bookable again, then each session must have this setting changed back to ‘Available’. ‘Exclusive’: With this option selected, as soon as a single booking is made into a specific session, then no one else can book that session (even if there are still some spaces available). This is most often used for group talks, when, for example, only one organisation or one school party can book into that specific talk/session. 'Restrict Tickets': This button can only be used once the PLU's have been linked to a 'Session Type'. 1. Clicking on the 'Restrict Tickets' button for a specific session time takes you to the below screen. If required you can then click in the the box next to the ticket (PLU) description, so it becomes unticked. Any 'unticked' PLUS will not be able to be sold for that specific session date / time only. 2. Clicking on the 'Restrict Tickets' button again returns you back to the previous screen. Once all options have been set as required, click on the ‘Save’ button to accept the changes. If required, click the ‘New’button and repeat the process to add sessions for all other times for that date. Once all the required sessions have been created for that date, they can be copied into other dates. To do this click the ‘Copy’ button. Now the screen ‘Select Sessions/Tours to Copy’ will appear like the one below. 1. Please not by default all the session times are selected for that date. If you only want to copy specific session times only, you can click in the tick box for a specific time, so it is unticked. Any unticked session time will not be copied. 2. Next click the 'Copy' button. The following screen will appear, click ‘OK’. The following ‘Calendar Period’ window will appear. Click and drag to select the required date range to copy to. The required date range will now be highlighted in yellow (as above). Click ‘Select’ and the date range will now show highlighted in green (as below). Repeat as necessary, so that all the required dates to copy the sessions to are highlighted in green. Click the ‘Apply’ button. Next click the ‘Paste’ button. Next click on the ‘Yes’ button. You will then return to the sessions/tours setup screen shown below. The selected sessions have now been copied into the specified date(s) but please check to make sure you did this correctly. Please note you cannot copy and paste the same sessions again as it's a one off. Once specific session types / dates / times have been copied into a session location, those same session session types / dates / times cannot be copied over the top of the existing ones. This is by design and to prevent overwriting existing data. Repeat as required then finally click ‘Close’. Assigning PLU’s to a Session Now the session has been created, the required PLU’s need to be linked to the ‘Session Type’. To do this you need to 1. Click Setup 2. click Pricing then 3. double click Price Lookup Index. Now find the relevant PLUs. The quickest way to do this is by 1. Selecting the 'Session Type' using the 'Session Type' filter. 2. Then click the 'Search' button Double click on the first PLU you want to link to a 'Session type' Next specify the number that will be deducted from the session availability when this PLU is booked. To do this enter the required number in the ‘Number per Ticket’ box (e.g. 1). 1. Click on the ‘Session’ tab. 2. Click the ‘Tour/Session Ticket’ box so that it becomes ticked. 3. Click the dropdown selector. 4. Pick the required ’Session Type’ to link the PLU to, using the dropdown selector here. 5. Click on the ‘Save’ button to accept the changes. Find all the other PLU’s and repeat the process to link them to this ‘Session Type’. These sessions can now be booked in the MStore software from the ‘Diary’ main menu option (Diary>New). Session bookings can also be made using the ‘Event Wizard’ functionality. This can be accessed either from the ‘Diary’ screen in the back-office software (Diary > Event Wizard) or via the ‘Event Wizard’ button on the till. You will need to make sure you have put the ‘Event Wizard’ command button on the relevant till screens in MStore and updated your tills. Please do not click 'Close' on the above screen as it will be needed in the next steps. Once you have done the next steps for the first time, then this can be done immediately after applying the above settings, i.e. without coming out of the 'PLU Maintenance' screen. This will save you time. Setting Up Online Session Bookings To make sessions bookable online, several additional steps required, which are detailed in the following sections. Internet Prices You should already have the 'Prices Index' screen open. If not follow the instruction in the previous section on how to search for PLUs. Once the PLUs have been searched for and can be seen in the 'Prices Index' screen, double click the first PLU you want to check the online (internet) price for. With the ‘PLU Maintenance’ screen is open for the PLU, click on the ‘View/Add Price’ button. Enter the required price in the ‘Internet Prices’ box. If the internet price was already correct and no change to the price was made, then the 'Apply' button will not be active. Please also check the ‘Price’, ‘Valid From:’, ‘Valid To:’ and ‘VAT:’ rate is correct at this point. If necessary, add any new prices for future dates ('Price Breaks') by clicking the ‘New’ button. Simply enter the relevant ‘Price’, ‘Valid From:’, ‘Valid To:’ and ‘VAT:’ rate(s), then click ‘Apply’. Please not there is a separate user guide on setting up 'Price breaks' to allow for different prices on different dates. Click the ‘Apply’ button if any changes were made. Once all the internet price data has been entered, click on ‘Close’ to exit the 'Prices History' screen. Click ‘Close’ again to exit the ‘PLU Maintenance’ Screen. Repeat the above process as required to enter the 'Internet Prices' for all PLU's that are linked to the same 'Session Type'. Once all the changes have been made click 'Close' to exit the 'Prices Index' screen. Creating Bookable Resources In order to book a session online, you need to create ‘Bookable Resources’ for all the PLU’s that are to be booked online. N.B. these PLU’s must first be linked to a ‘Session Type’, as explained previously. To create ‘Bookable Resources’, click on 1. Setup then 2. Bookings then double click on 3. Bookable Resources You will now see a screen like the one shown below. First you must select the correct type of bookable resource you wish to create. To select the type of bookable resource you wish to create using the 'Resource Type' dropdown selector. To set up online session you must select the ‘Resource Type:’ you must select the ‘Tours/Session’ option. Now click the ‘New’ button. Next click on the arrow next to ‘Unit Price’ (to assign the price for the ‘Bookable Resource’). This will bring up the ‘Prices Index’ screen you are now familiar with. Search for the PLUS as detailed previously. 1. Click once once on the first PLU you wish to create a 'Bookable Resource' from, so it becomes highlighted. Search for and select the required PLU by clicking on it (so it is highlighted in yellow). 2. Next, click ‘Use Selected PLU’ button. The ‘Code’ and ‘Description’ of the new ‘Bookable Resource’ defaults to that of the PLU selected. Amend these details as required, by typing the preferred ‘Code’ and ‘Description’ in the relevant box. The other settings on a 'Bookable Resource' are detailed below. ‘Show on Diary:’ Click the box to the right of the text ‘Show on Diary’ so that it is tickedif you want this bookable resource to appear on the MStore back office software ‘Diary’ screen (see section 9) when it's booked. ‘Print Times on Documents:’ Click the box to the right of the text ‘Print Times on Documents’ so it is tickedif you want the time that this resource was booked for to to be included on the default 'Booking Confirmation' letter (report) that is provided with MStore. this can be run as a report or can be provided. This can be run as a report (Report Bookings > Booking Confirmation) or is generated after opening a booking record by (1) clicking the 'Print' button in a booking, or (ii) is used to generate the attachment when clicking the the 'Email Conf' button (that can email a booking confirmation by Outlook - if your company have installed this. ‘Print Values on Documents:’ This is the same as the above, except it adds the time in the same way to the relevant documents. ‘Allow Booking from Internet:’ This setting only applies if you have purchased K3's online ticketing module. If not then simply leave this setting un-ticked, as it is not applicable. Click the box to the right of the text ‘Allow Booking from Internet’ so that it is ticked only if you want customers to be able to book this resource on your bookings website. Only applies to customers who have purchased the Online Ticketing Module (e-commerce web pages) from K3. ‘Named Tickets?:’ This is only for online bookings and is usually only used for birthday party bookings, when you need to record the name of the person the birthday party is for in the booking in MStore. Having this option selected means that when you book this resource online, a box appears in which you can enter a person’s name. To select this option, click the box to the right of the text ‘Named Tickets’ so that it is ticked .N.B. this name is not printed on tickets produced at the till (if applicable) when redeeming the booking. Please Note: The number of names to be entered corresponds directly to the quantity of the resource that is booked (i.e. if 5 of these resources are booked, then you will be required to record 5 names for this booking). Do not select this tick box, if you do not wish to record the name of each person a specified resource is booked for. Please note the name of the customer who is making the booking is recorded as standard. Part Payment (Online): This setting only applies if you have purchased K3's online ticketing module. Part payment can be set on each 'Bookable Resource' as required to allow part payment when the resource is booked on-line only. Part payment can be set as either percentage of the item price or a specific amount as required. ‘Edit Booking Letter’ Button’ N.B. if you want to create your own booking letters in Microsoft Word then do not use this option. If you do not how to set up and use Microsoft Word mail merge templates in the MStore, then this would require chargeable training. Please contact your Customer Success Account Manager and they will be able to provide a quote for your training needs. This option is only used if you want to use MStore's pre-defined single 'Booking Confirmation' letter (report) that is supplied with the MStore back office software and can be sent to a customer form within a booking record or run as a report (in Reports Bookings > Booking Confirmation report). If so, then you can add some additional text but only to specific sections of this letter by clicking on the ‘Edit Booking Letter’ button then you will see screen below. Please note you can only add text to three sections of this predefined MStore 'Booking Confirmation' letter letter as follows: Please note you cannot amened the font size, style, or colour, as this is predefined. Simply type in text as required in each section, then click on the ‘Ok’ button to accept the changes. Once you have made the required changes click ‘Apply’. Repeat the process to create all the 'Tour/Session' type 'Bookable Resources' as required. When all the relevant data has been entered then click ‘Close’ to exit the 'Bookable Resources' screen. Creating Booking Templates ‘Booking Templates’ need to be created to determine the content and functionality your online session bookings web pages. Essentially, ‘Booking Templates’ are created and the required ‘Bookable Resources’ are assigned to each template. On visiting a finished webpage, a customer will first be prompted with the available dates, followed by the available times. Then the customer is able to select from the list of ‘Bookable Resources’ assigned to the ‘Booking Template’ and pick the quantity of each one as required. For each resource in a ‘Booking Template’ some basic rules can also be assigned, for example, the minimum and maximum quantity of each ‘Bookable Resource’, these are explained in the following sections. To create a new ‘Booking Template’ 1. click ‘Setup’ 2. click ‘Bookings’. 3. double click ‘Booking Templates’. This opens the the ‘Booking Templates’ screen. 1. Click the ‘New’button to create a new 'Booking Template'. 2. Next enter the basic details needed to set up a session based online 'Booking Template': Enter the ‘Template Name’ as required. Select the required ‘Booking Type’ (these are user definable and can be set up in Set System > Lookup Items). The ‘Dated/Undated’ option must be set to ‘Date Specified’ using the relevant dropdown selector. The ‘Template Style’ must be set to ‘Sessions/Tours’ Please note there are other template styles that can only be used with session assigned a seating plan. Setting up sessions that require seat booking are outside the scope of this user guide ‘Allow From Internet’ tick box must be clicked, so that is becomes selected. 'Booking Template' Specific Settings There are other settings on each 'Booking Template' that are explained below. Session Filter. This is assigned using the dropdown selector where shown in 1. on the above screenshot. The 'Session Filter' for this scenario needs to be set to 'No Filter'. This would only be used where there are 'Bookable Resources' in a single 'Booking Template' that are linked to multiple 'Session Types'. This would not be used by the majority of customers and would only often be used by e.g. heritage railways. This is because such attractions might offer multiple different sessions for the various different train journeys that may have been set up as different 'Sessions Types'. Such attractions may want to offer these via one online booking template (web page). So this is a scenario a \"filter\" is often required to assist the customer user experience. For customers that may use this there is an option for a filter to show on session based web pages only, that can show either the 'Session Type' or the 'Session Description' or the 'Session Location'. Other Settings These refer to the other settings shown in sections 2. and 3. on the above screenshot and are detailed below. Use Location Master This setting is not required used – please do not use this setting. Hide Location Master from Basket This setting is not required used – please do not use this setting. Web follow on Template ID: This option is only applicable once you have created more than one online booking template in the MStore back office software. After a specific booking template is used online, rather than going directly to the payment screen you can automatically be directed to another K3 online booking template (web page). This is known as a \"follow on template\". For example, if you want the ‘Visit Santa’ Template to be automatically directed to another template, you simply enter the ID number of the other template in the ‘Web follow on template ID’ field then click ‘Save'. Please note the ID of a template can be found by clicking on any 'Booking Template' then note the ID number (e.g. 262). Create Sales Order for Dispatching This setting is not typically required for online templates that are used to sell admission tickets online. If ticked, when booked online a 'Sales Order' will be created in the relevant screen in MStore. This is typically only used for customers who have purchased our online shop module, where shop items needs to be picked and marked as dispatched. This is sometimes used by customers who have purchased the online membership module, to ensure member cards / packs are dispatched. Essential Items (Internet Only ): This functionality also requires each specific 'Bookable Resource' that counts to the number of \"essential items\" to have the 'Essential Items (Internet Only )' option ticked on the relevant 'Bookable Resources' (see below * in Section 2.3.3) . Here you then need to enter (where show) the total number \"essential items\" that need to be booked in total (in any combination)'. Please note: although any value can be entered here, the session will only allow the number to be booked that has been set up / allowed for the specific session date and time being booked (as defined in Setup > Bookings > Sessions/Tours). Max Per Template (Internet Only) If you need to restrict the total number of resources booked per booking to X then enter the required number in this field. Please note: although any value can be entered here, the session will only allow the number to be booked that has been set up / allowed for the specific session date and time being booked (as defined in Setup > Bookings > Sessions/Tours). TXGB Template This is only used for customers who have purchased an integration with TXGB. This is outside the scope of this user guide, please contact your Customer Success Manager and they will be able to provide a quote for your training needs. Pseudo Till to Use for Internet Transactions By default then a single till is used to record all internet booking transactions. If required then additional tills can be created and assigned using these settings. This allows the ability for multiple internet tills to be created and specific 'Booking Templates' (web pages) can be assigned toa specific till. You will not be able to add additional tills yourself, so if this is required then please contact your Customer Success Manager. Once all the required settings have been applied click on ‘Save’. Adding Bookable Resources to a Booking Template 1. Next click on the 'Booking Template' name, so that it is selected (it becomes highlighted yellow). 2. Then click ‘Add’. 1. There is a 'Filter' field in which you can use to speed up finding 'Bookable Resources'. It finds record containing the text / code entered enter part of a code or description, then click 'Apply'. 2. Click each box next to the required resources in ‘Tour/Session’ resources, so they are ticked. 3. Click ‘Ok’ to add these 'Bookable Resources' to your 'Booking Template'. You will now see the selected resources added to the 'Booking Template'. 'Bookable Resource' Specific Settings There are set per 'Bookable Resource' i.e. each \"ticket\" type can have different settings). Please note these settings only apply to online ticketing web pages, they do not apply to bookings made \"in-house\" (using the MStore till or back office software) To apply these you first need to click on a specific 'Bookable Resource' so that it is highlighted, then the settings can be applied. These settings referred to and shown on the screenshot and are detailed below. Min per booking: This stands for “minimum per booking”. This enables you to define the minimum number of this resource that can be booked per booking. For example, if this resource was for a group admission ticket that can only be booked for parties of more than 10 people, then enter 10 in this box. N.B. if there is no minimum booking requirement, then leave a 0 in this box. Please note: although any value can be entered here, the session will only allow the number to be booked that has been set up / allowed for the specific session date and time being booked (as defined in Setup > Bookings > Sessions/Tours). Must book at least one of these Select this option against a bookable resource to ensure at least one of this resource must be booked. For example, this could be selected against the resource for an adult admission ticket, to ensure at least one adult admission ticket must be booked. To select this option, click in the box to the right of the relevant text so that is becomes ticked Max per booking: This stands for “maximum per booking”. This enables you to define the maximum number of this resource that can be booked per booking. For example, if this bookable resource was for a special event ticket and you want to limit people to book only 5 of this bookable resource per booking, then enter the number 5 in this box. N.B. if there is no minimum booking requirement, then leave a 0 in this box. Please note: although any value can be entered here, the session will only allow the number to be booked that has been set up / allowed for the specific session date and time being booked (as defined in Setup > Bookings > Sessions/Tours). Named tickets? This is only for online bookings and is usually only used for birthday party bookings, when you need to record the name of the person the birthday party is for in the booking in MStore only. N.B. this name is not printed on tickets produced at the till (if applicable) when redeeming the booking. Having this option selected means that when you book this resource online, a box appears in which you can enter a person’s name. To select this option, click the box to the right of the text ‘Named Tickets’ so that it is ticked . Exclude Resource from Location-Master: This setting is not required used – please do not use this setting. Cannot be sold alone: Select this option against a bookable resource to prevent it being booked alone. For example, this may be used if we want to ensure that when booking children’s admission tickets that a responsible adult must also be booked. In our specific example we may select this on the ‘Summer Child’ resource, this will ensure either that at least one ‘Summer Adult’ or ‘Summer Senior’ resource must be booked first. To select this option, click in the box to the right of the relevant text so that is becomes ticked. Require Member Validation: This is only used where the memberships system has been set up and is in use. If needed specific ticket types (usually ones at special day / event ticket prices for members) can be set up so that they can only be booked if a valid membership card number is provided when booking online. To set this up the 'Require Member Validation' option needs to be ticked for each resource it is required on. Once ticked then the 'Choose Memb Types' button becomes active and needs to be clicked. A pop-up then appears in which you can click on the 'Membership types' that are allowed to validate that ticket type. Selected membership types show highlighted (blue). Once all membership types are selected in this screen, click 'Save'. Repeat for any other ticket types that require validation. Validation online will be by entering a valid (non expired) member card number of the specified membership type(s). Essential Items (internet only): Specific 'Bookable Resources' can be set to be \"essential\" in order for a booking to be able to be made. If the correct number of these resources are not selected then you cannot complete the booking, the customer will be prompted online if they try and pay without selecting pre-requisite resources. If certain tickets are deemed \"essential\" then each of the 'Bookable Resources' resource that counts as an \"essential item\" needs to be ticked where shown below. This then works in conjunction with one of the settings that is set at 'Booking Template' level (see above * ) Once all the required settings have been applied click 'Save'. Updating Online Email Templates To update your online web pages to reflect any changes made, click the ‘Website Login’ button. Clicking this button will open a web page, with a password box). You will be now taken to your website administration login web page. Type the password you have already been provided in the password field Next press the ‘Enter’ key on your computer’s keyboard. You will now be on the ‘Admin Menu’ page, click on the ‘Update Templates’ button. Wait for the ’Update completed successfully’ message. Please note these updates can take 5 minutes to take effect online. Once this procedure has finished, you can then press the ‘Logout’ button which is located at the bottom of this screen. The next section covers the recommended testing of your online session bookings pages. Testing the Online Session Booking Page Make sure you have clicked on the 'Booking template' name you wish to check. You can then view the online session booking page you created by clicking on the ‘View’ button The webpage created should now be thoroughly tested to check all 'Bookable Resources' are showing and that all the dates times, capacitates are showing correctly. If times and capacities available vary per date, check all possible scenarios When clicking on the selected date, all the required sessions times show for that date. Check everything is showing correctly, especially for specific dates / times where different capacities vary. When a time has been selected then all the tickets show at the bottom of the screen. Check you can select tickets and the numbers of these are restricted by the online session capacity sett for that date / time. Selecting tickets is either by dropdown or the + and - buttons, depending on how your web pages are configured. If any dates / times/ capacities / tickets / prices etc are incorrect / not showing please check all your set up. Click 'Add to Basket' to proceed to the “Shopping Basket” page. Now check the items added to the 'Shopping Basket' basket page correctly. Please note styling of this page and the following pages may look different to yours as this depends on what was agreed with K3 when the work to to create the pages was originally commissioned. At this point you can click 'Remove All' however if you want to do full end to end testing (as long as your online payment provider integration work is live) then you can click 'Checkout' to progress to the 'Checkout' page where the payer enters their name and address details, selects their GDPR preferences, and enter their card details and pays. Please note if your online payment provider is live this will take money from your account and land a booking in MStore. Any test bookings made on a live system would need to be refunded outside of MStore. Please speak to your online payment provider if you are unsure how to refund and they will be able to advise you. In the above scenario, you would also need to do a balancing refund transaction in the MStore, as refunds done via your online payment provider do not get passed to MStore. To make sure the figures in MStore are correct a balancing transaction needs to be carried out linked to the specific 'Booking Reference', this is known as a ‘Post Adjustment’ in MStore and these are covered in a separate user guide. Also to ensure the session availability is not affected you would also need to cancel any test bookings made, otherwise the test bookings will be withholding session availability. Footnote: If required there is also the ability capture extra data when selling specific items, this is know as PLU 'Data Capture' where up to 5 questions can be asked (per item) when it is sold. An example of how this looks is shown below and it is useful in events such as 'Visit Santa' type events where additional is required an is mandatory. However, please note the data can be set to not mandatory for other purposes as required. Data capture can also be set up and used for \"in-house\" MStore bookings. This is also covered in a separate user guide. If you require training on this or any of the above content, please contact your Customer Success Manager and they will be able to provide a quote for your training needs.",

    "title": "Block Seats Option",
    "text": "TABLE OF CONTENTS Introduction Using the ‘Block Seats’ Option Introduction For customers who use ‘Sessions’ that are linked to a ‘Seating Plan’ then there is the ability to ‘Block Seats’ for a specific ‘Session’. This is a way of preventing specified seats from being available to be booked until they are required on a session-by-session basis. This could be to reserve them e.g. for an external agency, for VIP’s, or simply for management purposes. This document explains how to block and unblock seats only, it is outside the scope of this manual to cover how to set up ‘Sessions’ or ‘Seating Plans’. If any training or consultancy is required on the set-up, or use of ‘Sessions’, ‘ Seating Plans’, or the ‘Block Seats’ functionality, then lease contact your Customer Success Manager and they will be able to provide a quote for your training needs. Using the ‘Block Seats’ Option Go into Setup > Bookings > Sessions/Tours. Select the required ‘Session/Tour Date’ and ‘Location’ from the relevant dropdown menus. Click on the required session, so that it becomes highlighted yellow. Click the ‘Block Seats’ button. You will now see the following screen. Click on a seat you want to block. The colour of the seat will change to indicate it is blocked. Repeat as required to block each seat. Alternatively use “click and drag” to block a range of seats. You will notice the blocked seats will all now appear in a different colour. N.B. If you make a mistake, to unblock a seat simply click on it again. Click the ‘Close’ button once all the required seats are blocked. N.B. these seats will only be blocked for this specific session. If you want to block seats for another session, simply repeat the process for each session as required. When you want to unblock the seats so that they are free to be booked again, click on the specific session so that it is highlighted then click the ‘Block Seats’ button. Now simply click on each blocked seat, this will unblock it. Alternatively use “click and drag” to unblock a range of seats. You will notice the unblocked seats will change back to their normal colour. Click on ‘Close’ once all the required seats have been unblocked. These seats are now available to be booked. You will now be back at the ‘Sessions/Tours’ screen (as shown below). To unblock seats for another session, repeat the process explained in this document.",

    "title": "Online Price Bands (Calendar Colours)",
    "text": "TABLE OF CONTENTS Introduction Locating the Price Bands Option Assigning Price Bands to a Calendar Updating Online Booking Templates Check Online Calendar Price Bands Introduction Online ‘Price Bands’ are a simple way of assigning colours to specific days or date ranges on the calendar (date selector) used on any of your online booking templates. The aim is to provide a colourised calendar, with a ‘Key’, in order to improve the customer user experience when making an online booking. This is most usually used to indicate where ticket prices change on specified days / date ranges, e.g. green coloured dates may represent ‘Standard Prices and red coloured dates represent ‘Premium Prices’. Where these are required, ‘Price Bands’ must be set up for each ‘Booking Template’ they are needed on. For each ‘Booking Template’, you can create the required ‘Price Band’ names and colours, then assign them to the calendar used for that specific ‘Booking Template’. Please note the system also automatically generates a ‘Key’ for you to show your customers what each of these colours represents. If you require any training on this functionality, please contact your Customer Success Manager and they will be able to provide a quote for your training needs. Please be aware that online ‘Price Bands’ are nothing to do with the ‘Price Bands’ option in the MStore back office software. Online ‘Price Bands’ are a totally separate concept and are just used to apply colours to the calendar used by a specific online ‘Booking Template’. Locating the Price Bands Option Access the ‘Booking Templates’ screen by1. clicking ‘Setup’ 2. click ‘Bookings’. 3. then double click ‘Booking Templates’. Click the ‘Website Login’ button. Clicking this button will open a web page, with a password box). You will be now taken to your website administration login web page. Type the password you have already been provided in the password field Next press the ‘Enter’ key on your computer’s keyboard. You will now be on the ‘Admin Menu’ page. To access the online ‘Price Bands’ functionality, click ‘Update Price Bands’. You will now see a screen like the one shown below. Click on a template description in the ‘Please choose a template’ list selection box. Click the ‘Add’ button. In the ‘Price Band Name’ box, enter the required name for this ‘Price Band’. In the ‘Description’ box, enter the required description. N.B. this description will be used in the ‘Key’ that is automatically created to show your customer what each of the price bands represent. Click the ‘Colour’ box and the easiest way is to enter the specific colour code in the 'R' 'G' 'B' fields if you have this code. Alternatively click the bar to select a broad colour type. Then click a point within on the colour palette to select your required colour. Then simply click anywhere off the this color selector screen to return back to the main screen. Please Note: The appearance of this colour selector screen will vary depending on the internet browser you are using. How the colours appear to customers may also not look like on your screen due to differences in device colour / brightness settings. Next, click ‘Add’. You will now see a message “New price band has been added”. Click ‘Ok’. To add a second price band, click on the template name again in ‘Please choose a template’ list and click ‘Add’. Repeat the process to enter the ‘Price Band Name’, ‘Description’ and to select the ‘Colour’ as before. Click ‘Add’ again. As before, you will now see a message “New price band has been added”. Repeat this process to add all the required ‘Price Bands’. Assigning Price Bands to a Calendar Now you need to apply the ‘Price Band’ colours to the required calendar dates for a specific template. 1. Ensure you click on the required ‘Booking Template’ from the ‘Please choose a template’ list of options. 2. Click on the name of the first price band you want to apply to the calendar. 3. Click on a date to select it or click and drag to select a range of dates. Repeat as required, until all the dates are showing in the colour for this price band. 4. Click ‘Apply’. 1. Now click on the next price band name here. 2. Once again click and drag to assign this colour to date(s) as before. Repeat as required until all dates are showing the correct colours in this specific year. 3. Click 'Apply'. Please note if you wan to colourise dates for future years repeat the process but at the point before selecting dates, then instead you need to select the required year and then select and colourise the sates in the same way as explained before. If other ‘Booking Templates’ need price band colours creating and applying, repeat the process as required for each specific ‘Booking Template’ as detailed in the previous pages. Once you have finished, click on the close button where shown. Updating Online Booking Templates To apply these changes to your online ‘Booking Templates’, they must be updated. You will be on the ‘Admin Menu’ page, click on the ‘Update Templates’ button. Wait for the ’Update completed successfully’ message. Once this procedure has finished, you can then press the ‘Logout’ button which is located at he bottom of this screen. Check Online Calendar Price Bands In the ‘MStore back office software, go into: Setup > Bookings > Booking Templates. Click on the required ‘Template Name' so it becomes highlighted yellow. Click the ‘View’ button where shown. Please also note that the URL for this template is shown in the ‘Website URL:’ box. * Check the dates are showing with the correct colour for each ‘Booking Template’. Check for each date in each year the ‘Price Bands’ were set up on and that the colours and ‘Key’ are showing correctly. Once everything is correct, provide your own web designer the URL for this 'Booking Template' (* see above). They will then need to add this URL to the relevant buttons on your own web pages.",

    "text": "TABLE OF CONTENTS Introduction Accessing Seating Plan Designer Creating a New Seating Plan Creating Locomotives Creating Coaches Adding Locomotives to a Seating Plan Amending Locomotive Dimensions Adding Coaches to a Seating Plan Amending Coach Dimensions & Adding Seats Creating Aisles Renaming Seats Adding Seats to a Price Band Editing Existing Seating Plans Editing Existing Coaches and Locomotives Assigning a Seating Plan to a Specific Session Introduction The following document details how to set-up a seating plan using the MStore back office software’s ‘Seating Plan Designer’. This document is primarily written for customers who require seats to be assigned when selling or booking train tickets, however exactly the same functionality that is detailed in this manual can be used to create seating plans for e.g. theatre, concert and cinema venues. Please Note: Seating plans can only be used in conjunction with ‘Sessions’ in the MStore back office software. For this reason, you must have had training on, and have set up all the required ‘Sessions’ in advance of using this manual. Likewise, you need to have received training on, and have set up all the required PLU’s and then link them to the relevant ‘Session Type’ before using this manual. Accessing Seating Plan Designer For customers with the ‘Trains’ functionality enabled: 1. Click the ‘Trains’ main menu option, then 2. click on the ‘Formation’ button. This brings up the ‘Seating Plan Designer’ window – proceed to Section 2. For customers who do not have the ‘Trains’ functionality enabled: Click 1. 'Setup', then 2. click 'Bookings', then 3. finally, double click 'Sessions/Tours'. Next, select 1. the required ‘Session/Tour Date’ and ‘Location’ using the relevant dropdowns. Now, click on 2. the first session time that you want to create a seating plan for (so it is highlighted yellow). Finally, click 3. the button shown to bring up the ‘Seating Plan Designer’ window. Creating a New Seating Plan Please note that first, you simply give this seating plan a ‘Code’ and a ‘Description’. The design of ‘Locomotives’, ‘Carriages’ and ‘Seat Blocks’ used in seating plans is covered later in this manual. For our customers who are using the ‘Trains’ functionality: Seating Plans are created for all the possible combinations of engines and coaches that may ever be used. Alternatively, for our customers who are not using the ‘Trains’ functionality: Seating Plans are created for all the possible seating layouts used for concerts, theatre or cinema performances. To create a new ‘Seating Plan’ simply type in the required name of this plan in the ‘Seating Plan’ box. Then type in the required ‘Code’, then ‘Description’ for this seating plan where shown. Once these details have been entered, click on the ‘Save Plan’ button. In order to create a ‘Seating Plan’, first: For customers using the ‘Trains’ functionality: All the required ‘Locomotives’ and ‘Coaches’ need to be made. Alternatively, for our customers who are not using the ‘Trains’ functionality: All the required ‘Seat Blocks’ need to be made only. To create new ‘Locomotives’, ‘Coaches’, or ‘Seat Blocks’, then click the ‘Add New Block’ button. Important notes for our customers who are not using the ‘Trains’ functionality: If you are creating a ‘Seating Plan’ for e.g. a theatre, concert or cinema venue, then the majority of the concepts in the manual still apply, however some concepts are unique to trains and are therefore not required. Below is a breakdown of the sections of the manual that are applicable, with some relevant guidance notes: Start at Creating Coaches but instead you create the block ‘Type’ of ‘Seat Block’(s) from the relevant dropdown. Please note, if you have a simple seating layout, then only one seat block may be adequate for the entire seating plan. If you have a more complex set-up (e.g. many different seating sections each with different ticket prices), then you may need to set up multiple seat blocks in your seating plan. Next, go to Adding Coaches to a Seating Plan but instead in the ‘Block Libraries’ section, select ‘Seat Blocks’. Next, follow Amending Coach Dimensions & Adding Seats. Entry of ‘height, ‘length’ and ‘width’ data is not mandatory but can be entered if required for customers operating trains. Finally, follow Editing Existing Seating Plans but you would only be editing ‘Seat Blocks’ in a seating plan. Creating Locomotives If you need to include specific ‘Locomotives’ in your seating plan, then follow the instructions in this section. If your seating plans only need ‘Carriages’, then go to Creating Coaches. You should now be at the following screen. Enter the ‘Code’ and ‘Description’ for this locomotive in the relevant boxes here. Select the type ‘Locomotive’ from the dropdown selection box here. Click on the ‘Save’ button. Click on the ‘Close’ button. Repeat as required until all locomotives are created. Creating Coaches You should now be at the following screen. Enter the ‘Code’ and ‘Description’ here for this coach as required. Select the type ‘Coach’ from the dropdown selection box here. (Remember for customers not using the ‘Trains’ functionality, here you select ‘Seat Block’ instead) Click on the ‘Save’ button. Click on the ‘Close’ button. Repeat as required until all ‘Coaches’ are created. N.B. all other aspects of configuring and using coaches in seating plans are covered later. Adding Locomotives to a Seating Plan Make sure the correct seating plan name is selected in the ‘Seating Plan’ dropdown. In the ‘Block Libraries’ section, click the ‘Locomotives’ button. Drag and drop a locomotive to the required position. Now you can click and drag the locomotive to adjust its position. At this point you can resize the block for the locomotive you have just added. Right click on the locomotive block and then left click on the ‘Resize Block’ option. Click and drag anywhere in the block (using the left mouse button) to resize the block as detailed below: Click and drag vertically (up or down) to adjust the height of the block as required. Click and drag horizontally (left or right) to adjust the width of the block as required. Click and drag diagonally to simultaneously adjust both the height and width of the block as required. Use any of the three resizing methods above to resize the block as necessary. Amending Locomotive Dimensions Double click on the locomotive ‘block’ to amend its dimensions. Enter the required details here. Rows and columns are used to design the seating layout for carriages that have seats. For a locomotive that has no bookable seats, enter 1 in the ‘Columns’ box and 1 in the ‘Rows’ box. If required, enter the length of this locomotive in the ‘Length box for information purposes only. If required, enter the height of this locomotive in the ‘Height (m)’ box for information purposes only. If required, enter the width of this locomotive in the ‘Width (m)’ boxes for information purposes only. N.B. the length will be used to calculate the total length (m) for a seating plan. Once the required details have been entered click the ‘Redraw’ button. Click the ‘Save’ button, then click the ‘Close’ button. You now know how to add a locomotive to a seating plan. Repeat as required to add locomotives to all relevant seating plans. Adding Coaches to a Seating Plan Make sure the correct seating plan is selected in the ‘Seating Plan’ drop down (in the top left corner). In the ‘Block Libraries’ section click on the ‘Coaches’ button. (Remember for customers not using the ‘Trains’ functionality, here you select ‘Seat Blocks’ instead) The list of all the coaches you have created will now be showing here. Click and drag the first coach (from the list of coaches) to the required position. Now click and drag the coach you added, so that it is in the required position on the page. Please note at this point you may wish to resize the coach you just created. Repeat the process to add all the new coaches that are required. Please note, you can right click on a locomotive or coach to see the additional options shown below. After right clicking, select the required option using a left mouse click. If you select the ‘Font’ option, you will see the screen below. Make the required changes, then click the ‘Ok’ button. If you select the ‘Back Colour’ (background colour) option, you will see the screen below. Select the required colour, then click the ‘Ok’ button. If you want to remove a coach or locomotive from the seating plan, right click the block in question. Now left mouse click the ‘Remove Block’ option to remove the selected locomotive/coach from the seating plan. How to use the ‘Resize Block’ option is explained in Amending Locomotive Dimensions. Amending Coach Dimensions & Adding Seats Double click the block in the seating plan to amend its details. Enter the details as required here for this coach. Columns: Enter the required number of ‘Columns’ here (N.B. extra columns may be needed for creating aisles – creating aisles is detailed later). Rows: Enter the required number of ‘Rows’ here. (N.B. extra rows may be needed for creating aisles – creating aisles is detailed later). Length (m): Enter the length in metres. (this will be used to calculate the total length of the train). Height (m): Enter the height in metres (this is entered for information only). Width (m): Enter the width in metres (this is entered for information only). Back Colour: Click here to select the default background colour. (this will change the colour of any seats marked as ‘Hidden’ – see Creating Aisles) Click the ‘Redraw’ button and you will see the grid of seats appear as shown below. Click ‘Save’ at this point to save these changes. You will notice a default seat numbering system is used (changing seat numbers is detailed in Renaming Seats). Creating Aisles If you want to make aisles click on a specific seat where the aisle will start. Next click the ‘Hidden’ tick box and the seat will turn white (indicating the seat is hidden). You can repeat this process a seat at a time, to mark all the required seats as hidden. Alternatively, you can mark a range of seats as hidden by using “click and drag”. Simply click on any hidden seat, then click and drag vertically or horizontally to another seat. This will change all the seats you just selected to be hidden (i.e. they will turn white by default). Repeat the process until all the required aisles have been created, then click the ‘Save’ button. Renaming Seats You can rename the seats as required to reflect the seat numbering you need for each coach. To do this click on a seat you wish to rename. Type in new name for this seat in the ‘Name’ box, e.g., “16D” and you will see the name change. Click in the next cell and repeat the process until all the seats are renamed. Click the ‘Save’ button once all the seats have been renamed. Adding Seats to a Price Band Where different classes of seats are available, ‘Price Bands’ can be set up to represent each available class of seat (e.g. you might create ‘Price Bands’ called ‘Standard Class’ and ‘First Class’). Please note, that even if you do not offer different “classes” of seats then at least one price band must be set up in the MStore back office software (e.g. in this scenario one price band called “Standard” might be created). For this reason, each ‘Price Band’ that is required must be set up before you can assign seats to a specific ‘Price Band’. Setting a ‘Price Band’ up is not covered in this manual, so please follow the procedure as per your training to add the required price bands (reminder this is done in Setup > Pricing > Price Bands). Once each ‘Price Band’ has been created you can then assign each seat to the required ‘Price Band’, this process is detailed below. Click on the first seat that you will need to assign a ‘Price Band’ to (e.g. 1A). Next click the required ‘Price Band’ and the seat will then change to the colour of that ‘Price Band’ (in this seat \"Class\" Repeat as required until all the seats are in the correct ‘Price band’. Alternatively, you can mark a range of seats as hidden by using “click and drag” (see Creating Aisles). Now click on the first cell (“seat”) that will be in the next ‘Price Band’ (e.g. 5A). Next click on the required ‘Price Band’ (“class”) for this seat here, so that it is selected (in this case 'Second Class). Repeat as required until all seats have been allocated to this ‘Price Band’ (or use “click and drag”). Once you have finished this process click the ‘Save’ button to save the changes. Next click the ‘Close’ button. Repeat the same process for all coaches to allocate all seats to the required ‘Price Band’(s). Once you have finished this process click the ‘Save Plan’ button to save the changes to this ‘Seating Plan’. You now know how to create a seating plan. Repeat the entire process described in this manual to create each ‘Seating Plan’ that is required. Remember to click the 'Save Plan' button to save the changes to this ‘Seating Plan’ as required. Once all the seating plans you need have been created, then click the ‘Close’ ('X') button in the top right corner. Editing Existing Seating Plans You will recall there are two different ways of accessing the ‘Seating Plan Designer’. See Accessing Seating Plan Designer which details in full how to access this module. Pick the required ‘Seating Plan’ from the dropdown selector here. If necessary, you can move / amend the position of a block by clicking and dragging it as explained previously. You can also right click a block to access the additional options for this block (‘Font Colour’, ‘Back Colour’, ‘Resize Block’ and ‘Remove Block)’ to change them as required. Once any changes have been made, click the ‘Save Plan’ button. Editing Existing Coaches and Locomotives Select the type of block you want to edit by clicking on either ‘Coaches’ or ‘Locomotives’ here. Next double click on the specific coach or locomotive you want to edit here. The specific coach or locomotive will now be showing. Amend all the details of the specific coach or locomotive as required (as detailed previously). Click the ‘Save’ button to save any changes you made. Repeat as required to make changes to any other coach or locomotive. Click the ‘Close’ button (in the above screen), once you have finished making the required changes. Click the 'X' button in the top right corner of the screen to exit the ‘Seating Plan Designer’. You now know how to create and edit seating plans, coaches and locomotives. Assigning a Seating Plan to a Specific Session You will recall there are two different ways of accessing the ‘Seating Plan Designer’. See Accessing Seating Plan Designer which details in full how to access this module. Once you are in the ‘Seating Plan Designer’: Pick the required ‘Session/Tour Date’. Pick the required session ‘Location’. Click on a specific session that will have a ‘Seating Plan' (so it becomes highlighted yellow). Select the required ‘Seating plan’ using the dropdown shown. 1. Once the required seating plan has been selected then it will be seen where shown below. 2. Where shown the figures will update to reflect the seat numbers in the selected seating plan 3. Click 'Save' to save the changes. You now know how to assign a session to the required seating plan. Repeat this process to assign each session to the relevant seating plan.",

    "text": "TABLE OF CONTENTS Departments - Introduction Editing Departments Adding a New Department Sub Departments Introduction Adding and Editing Sub Departments Security Groups- Introduction Editing Security Groups Adding Security Groups Removing Security Groups Users - Introduction Adding New Users Editing Users Deactivating/Reactivating Users Departments - Introduction 'Departments' are setup to allow reporting based on groups of tills as per your requirements. A simple example would be to have departments of ‘Admissions’, ‘Hospitality’ and ‘Retail’ to monitor transactions and cash flow the tills in these areas ('Departments') of the business. Another benefit of setting up different 'Departments' is that it gives greater control over the information 'Users' can access in the MStore back office software. Users can be setup so that they are restricted to only see and update information in MStore for the 'Department' they are assigned to. N.B. setting up new 'Users' must be carried out after setting up the required 'Security Groups', both of which are covered in this guide in the relevant sections. Editing Departments Departments are setup by first clicking 1. ‘Setup’ icon, then 2. click 'System' then 3. double click ‘Departments’ icon. You will now see a 'Departments' screen like the on below. For brand new customers there are typically three 'Departments' already set up for you; these are ‘Admissions’, ‘Retail’ and ‘Hospitality’. However for existing customers there will be all the various Departments and Sub-Departments showing that have been set up by your colleagues in MStore. But the process of adding / editing theses is the same and is detailed below. To edit one of the existing 'Departments', click on it so that it becomes highlighted. Each 'Department' is made up of a 'Code' (10 characters maximum) and a 'Description' (30 characters maximum), which can be seen in the ‘Department Details’ section of this screen. To amend either the 'Code' or 'Description' of an existing 'Department', click in the relevant box. Change this information to be as required and then click the ‘Save’ button. Adding a New Department To create a new department, click the ‘New’ icon Type in the required 'Code' and 'Description' for this 'Department'. Next click on the ‘Save’ button and the new 'Department' will be added. Repeat as required to create all the 'Departments' you need. Sub Departments Introduction 'Sub-Departments' can provide another level of reporting below each 'Department'. N.B. you must set up at least one Sub-Department for each Department you have created (as when tills are set up in a separate process then each till is mapped to a 'Sub-Department' for reporting purposes. When tills are created If you do not require any additional breakdown at the 'Sub-Department' level, you would simply create a 'Sub-Department' with the same 'Code' and 'Description' as the 'Department' it belongs to. Adding and Editing Sub Departments For new customers default, three 'Sub-Departments' exist ‘out of the box’, one to mirror each of the default 'Departments'. You can see which are 'Sub-Departments' as these are the ones with and entry showing in the 'Sub-Dept' column. To edit an existing 'Sub-Department' click on it so that it becomes highlighted. Just like a 'Department', a 'Sub-Department' also has a 'Code' (max 10 characters) and a 'Description' (max 30 characters). The only difference to setting up a 'Department' is that to create a 'Sub-Department' you must select a ‘Parent Dept’ using the relevant drop-own menu. The 'Parent Dept' you select determines which 'Department' this 'Sub-Department' belongs to. Amend the 'Code' and 'Description' by typing in the correct details and if required amend the 'Parent Dept' by picking it from the relevant drop-down menu. Click on the ‘Save’ button to accept the changes. Alternatively, you may need to add 'Sub-Departments' to give you the required granularity for reporting purposes. In the 'Department' of ‘Admissions’ you may have tills that are in two distinct areas need that you need to get a split between, e.g. the ‘North Gate’ and ‘South Gate’ admissions. So these might be examples of 'Sub-Departments' that you need to set up. To add a new 'Sub-Department', click on the ‘New’button. Enter the code and description for the 'Sub-Department' as required. As a 'Sub-Department' must belong to a 'Department', you need to select the name of the 'Department' it belongs to using the ‘Parent Dept’ (Parent Department) drop-down menu. Once you have entered the required information, click on the ‘Save’ button. Repeat as required to create all the required 'Sub-Departments'. This will allow you to be able to filter specific sales reports in Mstore by a 'specific Department' or 'Sub Department' to produce reports on sales for different till groupings as required. Security Groups- Introduction 'Security Groups' control the level of access given to Users that are assigned to that 'Security Group'. This not only means that Users are restricted on what they can and cannot do, they can also be restricted to seeing only information for a specific 'Department' or 'Sub-Department' (such as running reports only for a specific 'Department' and 'Sub Department' only). This enables Users of the MStore back office software to have only the buttons and functionality they require, as defined by the Security Group they are assigned to. Editing Security Groups The creation and management of Security Groups in MStore is done from the ‘Security Groups’ screen. This can be found by clicking on 1. the ‘Setup’ icon, then 2. click ‘Security’ icon, then 3. double click 'Security Groups' The 'Security Groups' screen is a very simple and easy to use screen. There are two main parts of the screen which you need to pay attention to, the first being the ‘Security Group’ drop-down. Use this drop-down to select the Security Group you wish to review or update. The second part of the screen is the ‘Permissions’ window, this is where you can select what you want this ‘Security Group’ to have access to (i.e. the permissions for the ‘Security Group’). You will notice several small + icons to the left of some of the permissions. This shows that there are more access rights within that permission and can be revealed by clicking on the +. Click on the + and the sub-menu of permissions will now be displayed You will notice that the + symbol you clicked on has now change to a – symbol. You will notice a new sub-menu will be displayed (potentially with more permissions with + icons next to them, indicating there are additional sub menus to be displayed). Once you have found the relevant permission it can be changed by either: (i) right clicking on the permission you want to change. (ii) left clicking on the permission and pressing the space bar on your keyboard. You will notice that the tick either changes from a green tick to a red cross (indicating the permission is removed), or from a red cross to a green tick (indicating the permission is granted). Please note that changing the permissions in a ‘Security Group’ will affect all the Users that are in that ‘Security Group’. Once you have made the required changes to all the required permissions within a ‘Security Group,’ click on the ‘Apply’ button to accept the changes. You can then pick the next ‘Security Group’ from the drop-down list and repeat the process until all permissions are set as required for each ‘Security Group’. Adding Security Groups To add a new ‘Security Group’, click on the ‘New’ icon. The ‘New Security Group’ window is loaded, as shown below. You must enter a 'Code' for this ‘Security Group’ (maximum 3 characters). Next enter a 'Description' for this ‘Security Group’ (maximum 25 characters). Click the ‘OK’ button to accept these changes. Alternatively click the ‘Cancel’ button at this point to exit and lose all changes. In most the other fields can be left blank these would only be used for the few customers that have purchased card printers and are printing their own clerk login cards. For more information and a quote if required, please contact your Customer Success Account manager. Your new ‘Security Group’ has now been created and added to the list. You will notice that each ‘Security Group’ is created with no access rights at all. Please note you must add all the required access rights for each ‘Security Group’ you create. Once all the required permissions have been set for this ‘Security Group’, click ‘Apply’ button to accept these changes. Removing Security Groups In the event of needing to remove a ‘Security Group’, first select the one you wish to delete using the drop-down menu. N.B. this should only ever be done if you have first re-assigned all users in this Security Group to an alternative one. With the required ‘Security Group’ selected, next click on the ‘Delete’ button. You will be asked to confirm that you want to delete the Security Group. Upon clicking the ‘Yes’ button, the Security Group is deleted. Upon clicking the ‘Yes’ button, the 'Security Group' is deleted permanently. Once the required changes to your Security Groups have been made, click on the ‘Close’ button to exit this screen. Users - Introduction The ability to create and manage 'Users' can be found in the following location. Click on 1. the ‘Setup’ icon, followed by 2. the ‘Security’ icon and then 3. double click on the ‘Users’ icon. This screen is divided into two main sections. 1. 'User List': This shows all 'Users' setup and a summary of their details. 2. 'Employee Details': this shows all information for the selected employee. Adding New Users To add a new user, click on the ‘New’ icon. The employee details section is now clear, you can input the details of your new user. ‘Security Group’ is the first option you must select when adding a user. To do this you must first click on the ‘Change’ button. You will now see the following screen. Click on the required 'Security Group' for this 'User' (e.g. ‘System Administrators’). Next click the ‘OK’ button. ‘Computer User Name’ is the next box you must fill in. This is the username the user will need to type in to log in to the MStore back office software. This can be up to a maximum of 25 characters which can include both letters and numbers. If you do not have any current convention for usernames, then you we recommend just entering e.g. a username based on the person’s initials. ‘Swipe Card Number’ is only entered if you have purchased swipe cards for logging onto the till. If this user is to log on to the till using a \"swipe card\" then enter employee’s swipe card number here (this number should be printed on the cards you were supplied by your preferred card printer / supplier). These could either be magnetic stripe cards or barcoded cards that are used for till login purposes, for more details contact your Customer Success Account Manager for details of and a quote for the hardware requirements, as depending on the card type purchased you will need either scanners or magnetic swipe card readers to have been installed by K3 on your tills. If you will not use \"swipe\" cards to login to the till this value is left at 0 in this field. ‘Full Name’ section is where you enter the name for this user. To enter the required information, you must 1. click on the ‘Full Name’ button. 2. Enter the other information as required: If required, select a ‘Title’ using the drop-down menu (e.g. 'Mr') Enter the required ‘Forenames’ and ‘Surname’ in the relevant boxes.

Please note if you have purchased the post code look up software integration for the back office software, then you can type in the post code then click 'Search'. The list of addresses returned for this postcode will be shown as a dropdown, from which to select the correct address to populate the address fields automatically. If you do not have the post code look up integration and want to find out more and get a quote, please Customer Success Account Manager. The 'Our Reference' and 'Delivery FAO' are only necessary for 'Users' that will create 'Purchase Orders' in MStore, which is covered in a separate manual, so these can be entered if required. Likewise if you want to enter any notes about this 'User' then these can also be entered as required (e.g. \"Part time Monday and Thursday shifts only\") in the 'Notes' field. 3. Click the ‘OK’ button to accept these changes. ‘Max P/O Auth Amount’ is only required if this user will use the Mstore 'Purchase Orders' system to raise purchase orders. This is the maximum Purchase Order value that this 'User' can authorise, so enter the amount as required. If this user will not be raising any Purchase Order in MStore this can be left at 0.00. As explained previously the MStore 'Purchased Order' functionality is covered in another user guide an dis outside the scope of this manual. The 'Department' and 'Sub-Department' drop-downs are used to specify which 'Department' that user belongs to. This can be setup so that the user can only view information in MStore for their 'Department'. Use the drop-down menu to pick the required 'Department' and 'Sub-Department' for this user. It is now also possible to assign employees to an 'Outlet' (y an additional dropdown selector above the 'Department' selector, but this is only for customers that need and have set up 'Outlets'. This is useful for organisations that want to restrict and report at different levels over and above department. 'Outlets' would first need to be set up (in Setup > System> Outlets). Then 'Sub Departments' can be assigned to an 'Outlet' to define which tills make up an 'Outlet' for reporting purposes. Then by allocating 'Users' to an 'Outlet' this will those users are then only able to view information and reports for the 'Outlet' they have been assigned to in the above screen. Please note if you do nit have this functionality then you will require a back office software upgrade, so please contact your Customer Success Account Manager. The contact details section can be filled in simply by clicking in each field and entering the details as required. Enter the required ‘Home Telephone’, ‘Work Telephone’, ‘Mobile Telephone’, 'Car Reg:' and ‘E-mail’ details as required. ‘Notes’ is a text box that can be filled in with any information that might be useful about that user. If the 'Notes' box is not big enough, then click on the button (to the right of the Notes box). This will open a new window with a larger text box. This can be used to enter more detailed notes about this user. Once you have finished entering the required notes click the ‘OK’ button. Click on the ‘Save’ button and the new user will be created. Once a new user has been created, you must setup their new 'Password' and 'PIN'. By default the Password entered for this user will be required for them to login to the MStore back office software. The user will login to MStore by entering both their 'Computer User Name' and the 'Password' you enter for this user. The 'PIN' will be used for the user to login to the till. To set the 'Password', click on the ‘Change’ button. Type the new password in the ‘New Password’ box. Next you must retype the password in the ‘Confirm Password’ box. Click the ‘OK’ button. A warning is now displayed advising that the password change is not instant. Click on the ‘OK’ button to continue. The 'PIN' is the number a user enters to log onto a till. To set the PIN, click on the ‘Change’ button. Type the required PIN in the ‘New PIN’ box. Next you must retype the PIN in the ‘Confirm PIN’ box. A warning is now displayed advising that the PIN change is not instant. Click on the ‘OK’ button to continue. Once all the required data has been entered click the ‘Save’ button. Please note: you need to use the ‘Recreate Till Data’ option (in Edit > Recreate Till Data) to send any changes to your tills. Please remember to do this once you have finished adding / editing all 'Users' Editing Users Updating 'User' information in MStore is very straightforward and similar to the process of adding a 'User'. Select the user from the list at the top of the window, click in and update the field(s) that needs updating and click the ‘Save’ button. Please note you need to use the ‘Recreate Till Data’ option (in File > Recreate Till Data) in the usual way, to send these changes to your tills. Deactivating/Reactivating Users A 'User' can be deactivated and reactivated as required. This has the advantage that a user can be reactivated at a later date if required. To make a user inactive first: 1. Click on the user so they are highlighted yellow. 2. Click on the ‘Inactive’ box, so that it becomes ticked. 3. Finally click on the ‘Save’ button to accept this change. If you need to reactivate a user you will have to: 1. click on the ‘Show Inactive’ box, so it is ticked. N.B. an inactive user is displayed with a line through their user name. 2. Then click on the user to select them. 3. Click the ‘Inactive’ box, so it becomes un-ticked. 4. Finally click on the ‘Save’ button to accept this change.

If you have already purchased and are using the 'Gift Aid Management' module then you will already have been supplied the installation files and instructions that your own internal IT team or external IT support provider need to install. For customers who do not have this module already, as this module requires background installation, set up and training, please contact your Customer Success Account manager for more information and a quote. Security Group Settings For all MStore 'Users' that need access to the 'Gift Aid Management' module there are specific settings need to be applied to all the 'Security Groups' that need access to this module.

Select the first 'Security Group' that needs access to view / submit Gift Aid claims. 2. Click the + symbol to the left of the 'Allow Access to BOS Setup' (it will change to a - symbol, as shown below). 3.

Right click on the settings as required so they are ticked, to allow access to view and submit gift aid claim data as required. (please note if you accidentally turned and option on or off then right click it again to change this back as required) 5. Click 'Apply'. Repeat as required for each of your 'Security Groups' that need access to viewing/submitting Gift Aid claims. N.B. 'Users' need to log out than back into MStore for these settings to apply. Please note these settings alone will not make the 'Gift Aid Malmanagement' module work. This module will only work if the required background installation and configuration work has been carried has also been carried out.

Enter the account information provided by the HMRC. Please note for security if you don't want the password to be stored, click the 'Prompt for password each submission' box, so it is ticked. You then cannot enter a password and will have to enter this each time you generate a submission Click 'Ok'. You will see the below, click 'Yes'. Repeat as required if you have more than one charity for HMRC gift aid submissions. Data Security All of these details are contained in every gift-aid submission and are stored in our database. The HMRC Gateway password is stored encrypted. Searching for Claims The options you can use to filter search results as shown below are detailed in this section. Unclaimed Entries/Claimed Entries/All Entries This filters results based on whether they have been submitted to the Inland Revenue. The software will not allow you to perform a submission if it includes any claims marked as previously submitted. Customer’s Details Forename Initial: The first character of the customer’s forename. Surname: The customer’s surname. Postcode: The customer’s postcode. It does not matter whether a space is present. Analysis Code This filter results to only transactions which sold an item from this 'Analysis Code'. Date Range Date of last claim: This is the date on which you last performed a gift aid submission. Declarations From: The date from which gift aided transactions should be included. Declarations To: The date up to, and including, which gift aided transactions should be included. Branch Most MStore customers will not require and use the 'Branch' so this filter can be ignored inmost cases. For any customers that have been advised to and use this, then the required 'Branch' can be selected. Department / Sub-Department By default, all departments are included, however you can also filter results by which MStore 'Department' and 'Sub-Department' processed the transaction. Search When you click the ‘Search’ button, the program performs several functions: 1. Retrieves all of the gift aided transactions matching the above criteria. 2. Analyses each of the Postcodes to check whether they match the expected format. Any which do not match the expected format are marked as ‘No’ in the ‘Postcode OK’ column. 3. Formats addresses so that they are presented in a consistent format. 4. Calculates the total claim value. Please note you can also use the column headings to order data as this may help trouble shooting invalid data. For example if the search showed '1 invalid postcode' you can then click on e.g. the 'Postcode OK' column and it will sort data by this column. You can click on the column again to toggle the sort order as required. In this case is was toggles so that the 'No' entries showed at the top of the list. Any column can be ordered this way to assist checking and amending data as required. Gift Aid Claims Table This grid presents the retrieved gift aid claims after the ‘Search’ function has formatted them. The claims can be sorted by each column, by clicking on the column headers. This is especially useful when editing invalid postcodes, as you sort by whether the Postcodes are OK and see at once all of the records that require editing. The ‘Postcode OK’ column has a particular purpose: All claims must now have postcodes that match a valid postcode format. Please note - all claims must either have a valid postcode or be deleted. Please note that HMRC have specified a maximum length for the Forename and Surname of thirty-five characters each, and a maximum length of forty characters for the entire address (not including the postcode). Characters beyond this limit will either be truncated when saving, or that field will not be saved. Editing a Claim’s Details The ‘Forename’, ‘Surname’, ‘Address’ and ‘Postcode’ fields can be edited. The ‘Date’, ‘Date Claimed’, ‘Value (£)’ and ‘Postcode OK’ fields cannot be edited. To edit a claim’s details, simply double-click on the details you wish to edit and change them as required. In this example an invalid post code was entered and is edited as required. Changes are not saved until you either click on the ‘OK’ or ‘Apply’ buttons. However, please note clicking ‘Apply’ will prompt to save the changes but leaves the 'Gift Aid Submission' screen open. Clicking ‘Ok' will prompt to save the changes but then will close the 'Gift Aid Submission' screen. Please note after changes are saved if you made any errors, then you will then edit the data again to make any corrections. Deleting a Claim A claim may require deletion if the Postcode is invalid and cannot be corrected, or if the customer has asked for their claim to be cancelled. To delete a claim, select the claim and either: a. Press the ‘Delete’ key on your keyboard, or b. Right-click on the claim and select the ‘Delete’ option. The changes are not saved until you either click on the ‘OK’ or ‘Apply’ buttons. Again ‘Apply’ will save but leave the screen open, whereas ‘OK’ will save and close the screen. Please note, after changes are saved, they cannot be automatically undone. This is particularly important to remember when deleting a claim as undoing the deletion requires you to add the claim manually, requiring you to know the customer’s details and the transaction number. Adding a New Claim To add a new gift aid claim, click on the ‘Add New Gift Aid Transaction’ button and fill in all of the fields. The ‘Receipt Code’ must be filled in and match the transaction’s receipt code, as a gift aid claim must be linked to a transaction record. You are also required to fill in at least the customer’s ‘Forename’, ‘Surname’, house name/number (in e.g. ‘Address Line 1’). and ‘Postcode’. Click 'Ok' once the required data has been entered into this form (or 'Cancel' to exit this screen) Please note if you do not enter a valid MStore till and transaction number, the following message will show. You will not be able to proceed and add the gift aid claim unless a valid till / transaction number is entered. Click 'Ok' and you are returned to the 'Add New Gift Aid Transaction' form. Please note if you enter an MStore till and transaction number where there is already a gift aid claim entry, then the following message will show. You cannot add a transaction unless it is for a transaction where there is no claim already present. In this scenario the system will not let you add this submission. Click 'Ok' and you are returned to the 'Add New Gift Aid Transaction' form. If you entered a valid till transaction that does not already have a gift aid claim entry, the below will show, Click 'Yes' and this added transaction will now be visible in the relevant claim searches. Claimable Value and Tax Rate These figures do not form part of the submission; they are just used to inform you of the amount you are claiming. The basic rate of Income Tax is set by default to 20%. This can be changed, and the change will then be reflected in the claim amount. Export to Excel If Microsoft Excel has been installed on the computer by you own IT team or IT support provider, then clicking on the ‘Export to Excel’ button will open an Excel worksheet containing the contents of the gift aid claims grid. Submitting a Claim To submit a claim, click on the ‘Submit Claim to HMRC’ button. This will submit a claim to the HMRC of all of the gift aid claims in the grid. A submission will only be made if: 1. All postcodes are valid, and 2. None of the claims are marked as previously submitted If you have not marked your historical gift aid claims as submitted, do not resubmit any of these claims as you cannot simply edit / cancel them using the HMRC portal! Instead you must contact HMRC to resolve this. Please Note: Zero-value submissions are not accepted by HMRC: Although they are presented in the grid and marked as submitted when appropriate, this is just for your reference and they are not actually sent. Negative-value claims cannot be sent individually: instead, the value is totalled, and they are sent as an adjustment to current claim’s value. Submission Response The submission is divided into batches of 1,000 records: This so that if you have a slow internet connection you will not time-out when submitting records. Each batch is sent in turn to the HMRC portal, and then the software waits for a response stating whether each submission was successful. Marking Claims as Submitted If the submission was successful, each claim is immediately and automatically marked as submitted. Whether it was successful or not, you can view the message sent from the HMRC for the last batch by clicking the ‘View Details’ button. Submission Errors In the above instance this will open the error received from the HMRC in a web browser: Although the error report looks complex, the only important point is the cause of the error, circled above. In this case the charity details are not valid. All submission files are saved in the computer’s common application data folder. This is located in: C:\\ProgramData\\Merac\\Gift Aid\\ The files display their type (submission request or response) and the date. Note: The HMRC reference, 'irMark', cannot be added to the filename as it uses special characters that Windows will not allow as part of a filename. It must be found in each file by searching for ‘irMark’. They are not saved anywhere else, so please backup this folder if you require an audit trail: Customers have reported that HMRC have no gift-aid reporting tools! Adjustments to Previous Gift Aid Claims Occasionally you may need to adjust a previous submission, for example when a customer tells you that they are unable to gift aid, but you have already submitted their claim. As transactions are batched before sending to HMRC and the overall claim value must be positive for each batch, the maximum negative adjustment should not be more than £1,000 without contacting us first. We have looked for a method to make this very easy for you but have been unable to find such a method that leaves an audit trail and does not affect your Transaction / Cashup reports. As such, the process to create a gift aid adjustment is to sell a gift aided item, then refund that item but non-gift aided. Detailed instructions are below. The process to file an adjustment is as follows: Prerequisite: You must do this before you wish to make your first adjustment. Add a new PLU with the following specification (please ask whoever normally adds PLU’s): Barcode: GIFTAIDADJUSTMENT Category: Admission Ticket Short Description: Gift Aid Adjustment Long Description: Gift Aid Adjustment Override Price: Allow Price Override Price: £1.00 Claim Gift Aid: Yes Analysis Code: Select the correct one as required for this PLU to report to. Then, when you wish to make an adjustment there are two stages: Stage 1: Add gift aid adjustment by putting through a transaction Go to a till which has a keyboard (or take one with you). Type into the barcode box ‘GIFTAIDADJUSTMENT’ and press the Enter key. Click on the price. Enter the adjustment amount (ignore whether it’s positive or negative for now) that you wish to make and press the enter key. Please note that this value is treated as a normal gift aid transaction, i.e. the actual adjustment to the claim will be 20/80ths of this value. If the adjustment is negative then refund the above item (how you do this will depend on your till configuration, but normally you would select the item, then go into the ‘Supervisor’ menu and press the ‘Refund’ button). Press the ‘Subtotal’ then the ‘Cash’ button. The ‘Gift Aid Details’ screen will appear. If your adjustment is negative these details are not sent to the HMRC but are just a record for the adjustment reason. Some details like the postcode though will need to appear genuine for the program to let you continue. Press the ‘Exact Money’ button to complete the transaction. Stage 2: You must now cancel-out the value of the above transaction by putting through another transaction of the opposite value, but which is not gift aided. This ensures the cash-up and transaction reports will be correct. Type into the barcode box ‘GIFTAIDADJUSTMENT’ and press the ‘Enter’ key. Click on the price. Enter the adjustment amount (ignore whether it’s positive or negative for now) that you wish to make and press the ‘Enter’ key. Please note that this value is treated as a normal gift aid transaction, i.e. the actual adjustment to the claim will be 20/80ths of this value. If the adjustment you just performed was positive then you will need to make this balancing transaction negative by refunding the above item (how you do this will depend on your till configuration, but normally you would select the item, then go into the ‘Supervisor’ menu and press the ‘Refund’ button). Toggle gift-aid off (there will normally be a button on the till screen that does this). Press the ‘Subtotal’ then the ‘Cash’ button. The ‘Gift Aid Details’ screen will appear. If your adjustment is negative these details are not sent to the HMRC but are just a record for the adjustment reason. Some details like the postcode though will need to appear genuine for the program to let you continue. Press the ‘Exact Money’ button to complete the transaction.",

    "text": "TABLE OF CONTENTS Introduction 2. Enabling the GDPR Module 3. GDPR ‘Lookup Groups’ 3.1 GDPR. 'How Customer Data Used' 3.2 GDPR. Reason for Customer data 3.3 GDPR. Who can use Customer data 4. Where the GDPR Account Preferences Appear 4.1 Back Office Software and PoS 4.2 E-Commerce. Basket Page 5. Customer Data Extract 6. Customer Data Anonymisation 7. Auto-Anonymisation Introduction Once the GDPR module has been purchased and is turned on, then whenever data that is subject to GDPR requirements is collected (e.g. the customer or member contact details), a screen pops up during the data collection. This screen contains a tick-box list of GDPR preferences that can be filled in by your staff when this form appears on the till or in the MStore back-office software, or by the customer themselves when making a purchase on a MStore e-commerce page. As well as choosing the GDPR preferences for customers that chose to be contacted, there is also the ability to choose to not be contacted. The manual explains the following: How to turn on the GDPR module (* see above). Setting up the responses to the GDPR questions as per your business requirements. Capturing customer GDPR preferences. Extracting GDPR compliant customer data into Microsoft Excel. How to anonymise a single customer record. How to delete all photos and documents that were stored against all customer records. Auto-anonymisation of customer data. Please Note: Once the GDPR module has been turned on, the check boxes of “Ok to Mail” and “Ok to Email” are now redundant and will no longer show on the system. If you require existing customer marketing preferences data to be transformed into the new GDPR options, please contact your Account Manager who can quote for this work and training on setting up and using the GDPR module. So do not tun the GDPR module on without discussing this with K3. For this reason if you do not already have the GDPR module, then you will not be able to turn this on (as detailed in Section 2) unless K3 have enabled this functionality in the background. Enabling the GDPR Module To turn on the GDPR module, please follow the steps below: 1. Click the ‘Setup’ icon. 2. Click the ‘System’ icon. 3. Double click on ‘System Options’. 4. Click on the ‘General’ tab. 5. Click in the box next to ‘Use GDPR Module’, so the box becomes ticked. 6. Click the ‘Apply’ button 7. Finally, click the ‘Close’ button. GDPR ‘Lookup Groups’ To comply with the new General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), three additional ‘Lookup Groups’ describing your GDPR account preference options have been added to the ‘K3|mstore’ back office software. These can be found by: 1. Clicking on ‘Setup’. 2. Next click on ‘System’. 3. Finally, double click on ‘Lookup Items’. The three new ‘Lookup Groups’ that have been created for use with the GDPR module are shown below: As shown above the three new ‘Lookup Groups’ are named as follows: GDPR. Reason for Customer data. GDPR. How Customer data used. GDPR. Who can use Customer data. There are default entries (‘Lookup Items’) in each of these ‘Lookup Groups’ and these are detailed on the following pages. As usual you can add, amend and delete the ‘Lookup Items’ so that they meet the GDPR requirements of your specific business. Please note that adding / editing ‘Lookup Items’ is not covered in this manual. If you do not know how to add or edit ‘Lookup Items’, then this will be covered in the training that comes along with the purchase of the GDPR module. The ‘Lookup Groups’ used by the GDPR functionality are detailed in the following pages, you simply need to add the required ‘Lookup Items’ into each of these ‘Lookup Groups’ in the usual way. 3.1 GDPR. 'How Customer Data Used' A sample of the above ‘Lookup Group’ and ‘Lookup Items’ are shown below. 3.2 GDPR. Reason for Customer data A sample of the above ‘Lookup Group’ and ‘Lookup Items’ are shown below. 3.3 GDPR. Who can use Customer data A sample of the above ‘Lookup Group’ and ‘Lookup Items’ are shown below. Where the GDPR Preferences Appear 4.1 Back Office Software and PoS Once the GDPR module is turned on, the system will prompt the operator to enter the ‘GDPR Account Preferences’ automatically, immediately after you have added the relevant contact details. If adding a record using the ‘New’ record button in either the Members screen, or the Customers screen, then the ‘GDPR Account Preferences’ will appear after adding the contact details (as per the screen below). Note: The operator must select the “Do not make any contact” option if the customer prefers not to be contacted. The system will not allow the customer record to be saved with no option selected! Once the GDPR module is turned on, the ‘GDPR Account Preferences’ screen will also appear after adding the contact details via either the Member, Booking or Event Wizards screens in either the MStore software or on the till. Please Note: once the GDPR module has been turned on, the check boxes of “Ok to Mail” and “Ok to Email” are now redundant and will no longer show on the system. If you require existing customer marketing preferences data to be transformed into the new GDPR options, please contact your Account Manager who can quote for this work and training on setting up and using the GDPR module. 4.2 E-Commerce. Basket Page Once the GDPR module has been turned on, the same ‘GDPR Account Preferences’ options will also appear on the ‘Basket’ page of all your ‘K3|mstore’ e-commerce pages. A sample of how the ‘GDPR Account Preferences’ may appear on a MStore e-commerce page is shown below. The customer simply selects from the GDPR tick box options you configured earlier. Please Note: How this may appear on your e-commerce pages will obviously depend on the styling of your e-commerce pages, and your online payment provider, so your ‘Customer Preferences’ may not appear exactly the same as shown above (the above screenshot is just a sample for demonstration purposes). However, the ‘GDPR Account Preferences’ that show on your e-commerce pages will be the ones you have created, as detailed in the previous pages of this manual. For customers using his first time online then please discuss this with your Account Manager. WK3 may need to be commissioned to do some web page styling work, which will need to be agreed before this can go live on our e-commerce pages. Customer Data Extract A button has been added to both the Customers and Members screens to extract customer data to Microsoft Excel (as long as you or your own IT team have installed this on the required computers). The button is as per the one shown below. On clicking the data will automatically create and open a data extract in Microsoft Excel that includes: Customer personal information (names, addresses, telephone numbers etc.) Account Preferences Booking History Transaction History Information about customer letters (subject, when sent) History of Account Actions Customer Data Anonymisation Functionality has been added to the ‘K3|mstore’ back office to anonymise personal data upon the request from a customer. The button is in both the Customers and Members screens and is as shown below: When the operator clicks this button and confirms they wish to proceed with anonymisation the system will check for Bookings, Invoices and Sales Orders outstanding for the account (and if there are not any outstanding), then this will delete all personal customer information including: Names. Addresses. Telephone numbers. Emails. Direct Debit Details (only for customers who have purchased this module). Anonymise Sales Orders and Invoices. Reset account preferences to the “Do not make any contact” GDPR option. If a single customer on an account with more than one member gets anonymised, then any photos of that customer will be deleted but not the documents linked to the account (because we cannot tell which contact documents relate to). If it’s a single customer account or the last contact, then any linked documents will also be deleted. N.B. the system will keep an audit of who has changed account preferences, when they did it and what change they made. An audit will also be kept of when customer data has been anonymised, which records are affected and who performed the action. Please Note: If you need to delete any photos or documents stored on the SQL server, then please raise a ticket with K3 Support. A procedure can be carried out to delete such data by running commands in SQL, so this will need to be carried out by K3. Auto-Anonymisation Anonymisation of customer data stored in the MStore software can be configured to run automatically. However this is a chargeable \"add on\" and if required, please contact your Account Manager. Once turned on, this option will ensure customer records are automatically anonymised in bulk (e.g. once per month) The criteria for anonymisation will need to be discussed but anonymisation is usually set up for for customers who: Have not renewed their membership for over X years. Have not had any bookings for over X years. Have not raised a sales order for over X years. Have not been invoiced for over X years. Have not purchased any item through the MStore system for over X years. Please note that the auto-anonymisation of Gift Aid transactions (where applicable) will only be for Gift Aid transactions that are greater than 7 years old. Unless K3 are advised otherwise by your organisation",

    "text": "‘Lookup Items’ are required for many modules of the K3|mstore back office software, where the contents of dropdown menus can be user-defined. Each of the ‘Lookup Items’ must belong to a ‘Lookup Group’, the name of which corresponds to the specific dropdown menu you are trying to add to. Please note, not all dropdown menus are user-defined, some have fixed content which cannot be amended in the K3|mstore back office software. Commonly used ‘Lookup Groups’ you are often required to add ‘Lookup Items’ to include: Account Flags, Account Source, Account Type, Booking Source, Booking Types, Session Types, Session/Tour Leaders. The dropdown menus that you can control can be found and amended as detailed below: 1. Click on ‘Setup’. 2. Click on ‘System’. 3. Double click on ‘Lookup Items’. Select the required ‘Lookup Group’ from the dropdown. (in this example we will select the ‘Lookup Group’ called ‘Booking Types’) Click on the ‘New’ icon here to add a new ‘Lookup Item’ (to the selected Lookup Group). Enter a ‘Code’ (e.g. CO) and the required ‘Description’ for the new ‘Lookup Item’ (e.g. Corporate Bookings). Click ‘Apply’ to add the new ‘Lookup Item’. Repeat as required until all the items have been added. Click on ‘Close’ once you have finished adding all the required Lookup Items.",

If not, then you need to double click on the relevant icon on the device's ‘Home’ screen to open the application or whether you need to navigate to and open the app on this device. If you do not now how to access the app then your IT team or your colleagues may know how this was set up on your device.

Click the box to the left of ‘Enforce Booking Date’, so that it becomes ticked (or unticked as required). Click the ‘Save’ button to save this setting. If you try and validate a booking that is not for today’s date, the following message will be displayed. N.B. as this booking is invalid, it will not be processed, even if you click ‘Confirm Entry’.

It gives you insight into how busy you’re likely to be, how much people are spending, and how that compares to previous years. ? What You’re Looking At The Forecast screen shows one year’s worth of data — broken down by day — including: Projected footfall and sales Actual results How it compares to previous years Suggested staffing band (from the rota) Optional: Spend per Head (Per Cap) You can view this data by Department, Sub-Department, and Year End, using the filters at the top. ? How to Update Your Forecast Go to the Forecasts window. Select the year before the one you want to update from the dropdown in the top-right. (e.g. To update 2024, select 2023.) If you see days highlighted in red (e.g. weekends), they are marked as Closedin the rota. To include them in forecasts, go to the Staff Rota and change them to R.1 or another open band. Click Update Forecast (bottom right). Return to the current year — your data should now appear. ? What Each Section Means ? Date & Weekday Shows the calendar date and the day of the week for each row. ✏️ Notes This is an optional field where you can type reminders or labels like: “Half Term” “Event Day” “Sunny / Rainy” ? Per Cap Dpt Per Cap (Spend per Head) is an estimate of how much each visitor is likely to spend. The system fills this in automatically — unless you enter a value manually. Dpt means you're viewing it by Department. Tip: If you type in a Per Cap value yourself, it won't be overwritten when you update forecasts again. ? Footfall This section shows past, predicted, and current visitor numbers: ColumnWhat it means 2022 / 2023 How many people visited on this date in previous years Proj Projected footfall — based on a similar day two years ago Act Actual footfall so far today Var The difference between projected and actual footfall ?‍♀️ Staff Rota This shows the staffing band for that day — pulled from your rota (e.g. R.1, Closed).

Test that the online membership page works as required. The next section shows an example membership page and how it works online. Example Membership Page Navigation The customer must choose the quantity of each membership they require. Some memberships may be eligible for Gift aid and need the customer to accept or decline. If Gift Aid is an option, the ‘Gift Aid Declaration’ below is displayed. The customer then decides whether to accept the ‘Gift Aid Declaration’ or not. To do this, they simply tick the relevant box. You will now see a second question. The customer must answer this to clarify whether Gift Aid is applicable. Please note: The below screenshots are based on a a Version 1 memberships page. Some customers have Version 2 of the online memberships page, which will works slightly differently to the below screens. The customer will fill in the details for each membership. Mandatory fields have red asterisks. Customer will choose whether to mail shot or not by selecting the required option. Please note: The above screenshots is for customers that do not have our GDPR module. For customers with the GDPR module set up to work online, the above will be replaced by their GDPR options grid. Once the customer has entered in all the details they can select to pay now or edit the details. You will see the membership person’s name besides each of the memberships. The customer will then be prompted to select the billing address. They can select the address of one of the previously entered people. Alternatively, if the billing address is someone else, select ‘New Person’ and enter their details. The customers will then fill in their payment details and pay for the memberships. Once the transaction is completed the customer will receive a membership confirmation email, Membership Retrieval Upon First Visit Using the confirmation email, the members will have received temporary card numbers linked to each individual member. Any one of these numbers can be used to bring up the full account. Click on the ‘Membership Wizard’. Enter one of the card numbers in to the ‘Swipe card’ box. Now click into any of the other boxes (e.g. postcode). The software will now recognize this is a valid membership and load the membership details on to the screen. Now enter the card number of the new card that you have taken out of the box for this member. If required, take the picture for this member (as long as a compatible webcam is installed). To do this click on ‘Preview’ to start the webcam and then click ‘Capture’ to take the photo. If no picture is required simply enter the new card number only for the first member. Then click the ‘Next’ button to take you to the next member. Repeat the above process for the next member (if required). Once all member’s card numbers and photos have been updated, click ‘Next’. This will take you to the below screen. If nothing has changed, then simply click on the ‘Next’ button. Alternatively amend the details if required, then click on the ‘Next’ button. You will see the following screen. Members should now have proper cards and the member’s pictures have been taken (if required). The process is now complete end to end from setup, purchase and completing via the till in order to obtain the formal cards and take member pictures (if required). This process can be done via the new member ‘Wizard’ in the MStore back office software also, so there is no reason why this must be performed on a till. It is the same Wizard used on both the till and in the MStore back office software.",

    "text": "TABLE OF CONTENTS Introduction Online Shop PLU Settings and Prices Sales Groups for Online Shop ‘Product Images’ for Online Shop PLU ‘Category Image’ PLU ‘Product Image’ Updating the Online Shop Introduction In order to set up the ‘Online Shop’ you must already have had training on set up and amend PLU’s and Stock Items. The relevant PLU’s and Stock Items must also have all been set up in advance of following the instructions in this manual. The manual explains how to set up your online page to show you products in the required categories, and how to assign the relevant images to each category and product. There is also the ability to add additional text to each product, so you customers have the necessary information about each product. Online Shop PLU Settings and Prices Go into the ‘Price Lookup Index’ (Setup > Pricing > Price Lookup Index). Search for and open the required PLU Record so you are in the ‘PLU Maintenance’ screen below. Make sure the ‘Sell item on the internet’ box is ticked. Next click on the ‘View/Add Price’ button. Enter the price the PLU will be sold for online in the ‘Internet Prices’ box. (the ‘Inhouse Prices’ box is the price the PLU will be sold at on the till). Click ‘Apply’ if any changes are made, then click ‘Close’. Sales Groups for Online Shop Sales groups are simply the list of categories that will appear on your main online shop page. Each sales group has a name and can also have an image assigned to it. The main page of your online shop will display a list of these categories (sales groups), as well the image assigned to it. Click the glasses button to add the required sales groups. Click on the ‘New Record’ button to add your first sales group. Enter the required name for the sales group in the ‘Name:’ box. Assign the required image to the sales group by clicking the button to browse to the required image. Click the ‘Save’ button to save these changes.

Click the ‘Ok’ button once the required sales groups have been selected for this PLU. ‘Product Images’ for Online Shop As explained previously you will have a main online shop page that shows a list of categories (sales groups) and an image (if selected) for each category. Clicking on a category will then take you to another page, which displays a list of items in that category. The item’s image showing on this page is called the PLU’s ‘Category Image’. If you were then to click on an item, you will then be taken to the page for that specific item. The image showing on this page is called the PLU’s ‘Product Image’. Click on the ‘Product Images’ button to select the required product images that will be seen online. PLU ‘Category Image’ To assign the required image click on the ‘Category Image’ tab. Then click the button to browse to and select the required category image. Next click the ‘OK’ button. PLU ‘Product Image’ To assign the required image click on the ‘Product Image’ tab.

This will be used for all email confirmations sent from our online bookings, membership and shop pages. To edit this template, click on the button. You can now edit the text for this template as required here. You can make any changes to this template using the text editor. The email template itself is written in HTML but the ‘Email Template Editor’ screen allows you to make changes to the email template as text, i.e. without needing to know HTML. As you can see the ‘Email Template Editor’ is a basic text editor. Text can be entered into the template where required and the text styling (font type, size etc) can be amended by using the relevant buttons. The actions of the buttons on the top row of this button toolbar are explained below. The actions of the buttons on the second row of this button toolbar are explained below. The text editor converts the text you create into HTML for you, however if you want to view the HTML created you can use the buttons on the ‘toolbar’ at the bottom of the text editor screen. The button actions on the toolbar at the bottom of the text editor screen are explained below: Button: Action: Switch to HTML editor. Switch to text editor. Preview the email template. For our customers who are experienced at writing and editing in HTML, click on the button to access the HTML editor. Please note K3 do not provide training on or support any HTML you have written; this will need to be written and checked by a colleague or a third party that knows HTML. You will now see a screen like the one shown below. The required changes to the email template can now be typed in HTML in the window (shown above). To switch back to the text editor, click on the button on the bottom toolbar. Click on the button once all the required changes have been made. You will see the message ‘Template Saved’. You can preview how the template will look by clicking either the or buttons. To exit preview mode, click on the button located here. There is also functionality to send a test email, to do this click on the button. In the ‘Email Address’ box type in required email address and then click the button. An email showing a sample of how the email confirmation will look will be sent to the specified email address. Please check this and make any amendments as required and send further test emails, until the outcome is as required. If you make any additional changes remember to click the 'Save' button located at the bottom left of the scree. You will notice that there is also a selector screen here which shows a list of all your active, online ‘Booking Templates’ only Please refer to the notes* below. Notes: * Setting up ‘Booking Templates’ is not covered in this manual but these templates need to be set up in advance in Setup > Booking > Booking Templates. Each template must have (i) the ‘Template Active’ box ticked and (ii) the ‘Allow Booking From Internet’ option must also be ticked. If you do not want to use a single (“Generic”) email template for all your email confirmations that are sent out from our online booking pages, then you can create a different email template for each ‘Booking Template’ that is used online. Click on the name of the ‘Booking Template’ that you want to create a new ‘Email Template’ for. Please note that if you click on an email template and the ‘Email Template Description’, ‘Email Subject’ and ‘Email Template HTML’ boxes are all empty, then this booking template is currently using the ‘Generic Email’ template. Creating / Editing New Email Templates If you want this booking template to use a different email template, you must create a new one. To do this click on the ‘New Email Template’ button. Enter the required ‘Email Template Description’ in the relevant box. Enter the required ‘Email Subject’ in the relevant box. This will be the email subject that appears in the confirmation email that is sent when making a booking using this online booking template. Enter the required confirmation email HTML, using the either text editor or the HTML editor. Please note you can copy and paste text into the HTML editor. Once the required HTML has been entered, click the 'Save' button to accept the changes (bottom left corner of the screen) As explained previously, you can preview and send a test email. Repeat the processes described previously until all the required email templates have been created. Once all the required changes have been made, click here to close the email templates screen. This will take you back to the main ‘Admin Menu’ page. Updating K3 E-Commerce Pages To ensure the changes made to you email are implemented you need to update your K3 e-commerce web pages. To do this online click on 'Update Templates' and wait for this process to complete. Finally, click the button once you have finished using the ‘Admin Menu’.",

    "title": "Online Discount Vouchers",
    "text": "TABLE OF CONTENTS TABLE OF CONTENTS Introduction Accessing the Online Discount Vouchers Page Editing / Creating Online Discount Vouchers Extra Options Updating Online Templates Used Vouchers Report Introduction The Online Discount Vouchers functionality enables you to set up online discounts that are triggered by the entry of a code into the ‘Voucher Code’ box when you reach the ‘Shopping Basket’ page. This enables specific customers to be targeted by providing them with a discount code, rather than giving a discount to everyone. Accessing the Online Discount Vouchers Page Log onto your website ‘Admin Menu’ page as usual (enter your password and click ‘Login’) N.B. you should already have been provided your log on page and password details by your management team. If no one has this information, then a member of your management team can email requesting this information to Support team. A member of the Training Team will provide this information by email, as soon as they are next available. Click on the ‘Discount Vouchers’ button. Editing / Creating Online Discount Vouchers You will now see a list of all existing online discount vouchers that have been setup. To edit an existing online discount voucher, simply click on the ‘Edit’ button. We need to create a new online discount voucher, so click on the ‘Add New Voucher’ button. The ‘Voucher Details’ page is now displayed and needs to be filled in to create the new online discount voucher. Start by filling in the ‘Voucher Name’ and ‘Voucher Code’. N.B. the ‘Voucher Code’ is the actual code customers will need to enter on the website to get the discount. There are two different discount methods that can be set up in the ‘Voucher Method’ section: Percentage: A percentage discount given on the price, e.g. 10 % off. Absolute Value: This is a fixed amount of money that is discounted, e.g. £5 off. The ‘Voucher Value’ box is where to enter the % discount required, or the value of the absolute discount required (depending on the ‘Voucher Method’ selected above). Next the duration for which the discount will be active needs to be defined. Do this using the calendars to set the ‘Voucher Start Date’ and ‘Voucher Expiry Date’ ‘Voucher Type’ defines whether the discount is applied to specific items (known as ‘Item Reducing’) or the whole basket (known as ‘Basket Reducing’). ‘Item Reducing’ is the most commonly used, so this is the example we will follow. If you are using an ‘Item Reducing’ type promotion, then you need to select the ‘Bookable Resources’ which are eligible to be discounted. If you want to select multiple items, hold down the Control (CTRL) key on the keyboard and click on the required resources, so they all become highlighted. Extra Options There are are two additional options that can be set to give us greater control over the promotion if necessary. To see the ‘Extra Options’ screen, tick the box where shown. ‘Voucher Valid From Date’ / ‘Voucher Valid To Date’: This is simply the date the discount can be used and is selected using the relevant calendars. Match to quantity of these bookable resources: A discount can be set to trigger only the same number of times as the quantity of another resource in the basket. For example, you want to set up the discount so that each adult purchased will enable a % discount off the equivalent number of child tickets purchased. To achieve this you would need to select the adult resource from this dropdown by clicking on it. Then if you e.g. selected 3 adults in the basket, only 3 child tickets would be discounted. Once all the details have been set up as required, ensure you click ‘Save Changes’. A message saying ‘Voucher Saved’ will then pop up, click the ‘Ok’ button on this message. Updating Online Templates In order to update your online pages to make the voucher codes active immediately, first the ‘Discount Vouchers’ screen needs to be closed by clicking the relevant icon at the top of the page Next the online pages need to be updated by clicking ‘Update Templates’ as usual. Once finished, scroll down to the bottom of the web page and click ‘Logout’ to exit your website ‘Admin Menu’ page You should now test all the discount codes you have set up by going to the relevant online booking page and selling the required items. On the basket page you need to enter the discount code in the relevant box and click ‘Apply’. Check that the discount applies correctly. Repeat the process to check all discount codes you have set up work as required on all the relevant online ticketing pages. Please Note: If you have never used online discount codes then the code entry box may not be present. There is a website configuration option that is required to add this code entry field. If not already present please raise a support ticket with K3 support via the support portal. Used Vouchers Report Also on your your website ‘Admin Menu’ page, you are able to generate a 'Used Vouchers' report which measures online voucher usage. On the home screen of the ‘Admin Menu’ page access 'Reporting' (outlined in red) In the drop down menu, click 'Used Vouchers' (highlighted in grey) and then 'Select' (outlined in red). You can modify the date range and specify voucher codes in this section. Once the desired specifications have been added, you can then 'Run Report' (outlined in blue) to generate the results.",

    "title": "Online Price Bands (Calendar Colours)",
    "text": "TABLE OF CONTENTS Introduction Locating the Price Bands Option Creating Price Bands Assigning Price Bands to a Calendar Updating Online Booking Templates Check Online Calendar Price Bands Introduction Online ‘Price Bands’ are a simple way of assigning colours to specific days or date ranges on the calendar (date selector) used on any of your online booking templates. The aim is to provide a colourised calendar, with a ‘Key’, in order to improve the customer user experience when making an online booking. This is most usually used to indicate where ticket prices change on specified days / date ranges, e.g. green coloured dates may represent ‘Standard Prices and red coloured dates represent ‘Premium Prices’. Where these are required, ‘Price Bands’ must be set up for each ‘Booking Template’ they are needed on. For each ‘Booking Template’, you can create the required ‘Price Band’ names and colours, then assign them to the calendar used for that specific ‘Booking Template’. Please note the system also automatically generates a ‘Key’ for you to show your customers what each of these colours represents. Please Note: Online ‘Price Bands’ are nothing to do with the ‘Price Bands’ option in the MStore back office software. Online ‘Price Bands’ are a totally separate concept and are just used to apply colours to the calendar used by a specific online ‘Booking Template’. Locating the Price Bands Option Open the URL to your online ‘Admin Page’ and enter the required password and click ‘Login’. N.B. if you have already purchased the online bookings module these details have already been provided. If you do not have the URL, this can be accessed by clicking: Setup > Bookings > Booking Templates. Then click the ‘Website Login’ button and the URL for the ‘Admin Page’ will open automatically. A screen like the one below will now be showing. To access the online ‘Price Bands’ functionality, click ‘Update Price Bands’. Creating Price Bands You will now see a screen like the one shown below. Click on a template description in the ‘Please choose a template’ list selection box. Click the ‘Add’ button. In the ‘Price Band Name’ box, enter the required name for this ‘Price Band’. In the ‘Description’ box, enter the required description. N.B. this description will be used in the ‘Key’ that is automatically created to show your customer what each of the price bands represent. Click the ‘Colour’ box Select the required colour from the colour selector, then click ‘Ok’. Please note: The appearance of this colour selector screen will vary depending on the internet browser you are using. Next, click ‘Add’. You will now see a message “New price band has been added”. Click ‘Ok’. To add a second price band, click on the template name again in ‘Please choose a template’ list. Click ‘Add’. Repeat the process to enter the ‘Price Band Name’, ‘Description’ and to select the ‘Colour’ as before. Click ‘Add’ again. As before, you will now see a message “New price band has been added”. Repeat this process to add all the required ‘Price Bands’. Assigning Price Bands to a Calendar Now you need to apply the ‘Price Band’ colours to the required calendar dates for a specific template. Ensure you click on the required ‘Booking Template’ from the ‘Please choose a template’ list of options. You will now see the names of the ‘Price Bands’ you created here. Click on the name of the first price band you want to apply to the calendar. The name of the selected price band (and its colour) will now show here. Click on a date to select it or click and drag to select a range of dates. Repeat as required, until all the dates are showing in the colour for this price band. Click ‘Apply’. Now click on the next price band name here. Once again, the name of the selected price band (and its colour) will now show here. Click and drag to assign this colour to date(s) as before Repeat as required until all dates are showing the correct colours in this specific year. If you want to colourise next year’s calendar, then select the year here. As before, click the required template name where shown and repeat the process for this calendar year. Click ‘Apply’ once all the price bands have been assigned to this calendar. If other ‘Booking Templates’ need price band colours creating and applying, repeat the process as required for each specific ‘Booking Template’ as detailed in the previous pages. Once you have finished, click on the close button , at the top right corner of the screen. Updating Online Booking Templates To apply these changes to your online ‘Booking Templates’, they must be updated. (N.B. please see Section 2 if you do not know how to access the ‘Admin Menu’ page shown below) Click the ‘Update Templates’ option and wait for the update process to finish. Next, scroll down to the bottom of this page and click the ‘Logout’ button. Check Online Calendar Price Bands In the MStore back office software, go into: Setup > Bookings > Booking Templates. Click on the required ‘Template Name’ here, so it becomes highlighted yellow. Click the ‘View’ button where shown. Please also note that the URL for this template is shown in the ‘Website URL:’ box. * Check the dates are showing with the correct colour for each ‘Booking Template’ for each date in each year the ‘Price Bands’ were set up on and that the ‘Key’ is showing correctly. Once everything is correct, provide your own web designer the URL for this template (see above *). They will then need to add this URL to the relevant buttons on your own web pages.",

    "title": "Internet Redemption Methods",
    "text": "TABLE OF CONTENTS Introduction Deposit Mode By Item Mode Redemption Mode Introduction This only applies to customers who have purchased the MStore online ticketing module, as the following document explains the three ‘Internet Redemption Method’ options that are available. These relate specifically to online bookings made on our MStore e-commerce ticketing web pages only. If you are interested in having our online ticketing pages then please contact your Account Manager for more information and a quote. The three redemption methods that are detailed in this guide are: Deposit Mode By Item Mode Redemption Mode The configuration requirements and explanation of the differences between each of these methods and how they function is explained in detail in this document. Deposit Mode In this mode, all internet bookings will be processed as a single PLU. Bookings will be saved in MStore under the correct resource. Items sold online will be made up of different VAT codes. Normally the VAT is set to ‘Zero’ or ‘Outside Scope’. The final VAT will be calculated when the booking is redeemed, and the real PLU’s are processed the deposit is reversed out. A PLU is created and set within the system options: An example of the PLU that is created and set in the ‘System Options’ is shown below. The transaction reporting will show the same PLU but because the description will differ for the booking reference, it will split into different lines. Examples of the the transaction lines appear for this redemption method are given below: When recalled to a till it will process the correct PLU, record footfall, print tickets and complete the booking. It will reverse the deposit paid; the transaction balance will be zero. Revenue will increase for the ticket sales but reduce for the deposits. Completed bookings will no longer appear on the deposits held reports. By Item Mode In this mode, all internet bookings will be processed as the real PLU’s that are linked to the ‘Bookable Resources’. The footfall will not occur until they arrive and complete the booking. The Gift Aid and tax will be processed at the time that the booking was made, and the transaction was recorded. It will appear on the transaction reports as the real items. You can run the report based on “in-house” or “online” tills, but if you did not specify then the two would be added together. Examples of the the transaction lines appear for this redemption method are given below: N.B. if the “online” and “in-house” sales need to be seen side by side, then separate PLU’s can be made to sell the products online (i.e. a different set of PLU’s to those used to sell the products “in-house” need to be set up and used to sell the products “online”). When the bookings are redeemed, the till will refund out the amount already paid under the same barcode with the ‘Description’ “Less – Amount Paid” for each of the booking lines. The footfall will happen at the time of completion and any tickets will print. The items will be side by side on the reporting (as they are the same codes) and will balance out so no revenue increases. Redemption Mode In this mode, all internet bookings will be processed as the real PLU’s that are linked to the ‘Bookable Resources’. This mode is very similar to the “By Item” mode. The system will sell the PLU; however, the difference will occur at the time the booking is completed. Please note this mode was developed for and generally only used by one specific customer, so the other two methods are the ones used by the majority of customers with the K3 Online Ticketing pages On each of the bookable resources there will be an extra section where a second PLU is set which will be the one used when the booking is completed. The first PLU set will be the price for the sale, the second is the redemption PLU which is used when the booking is completed at the till. The second PLU will be where the footfall and the tickets are set, as this PLU will be recalled to the till and print the tickets. The reports will have a split between the sales and the redemptions as they are different PLU’s. There will be no reversals of any products. The VAT and Gift Aid will be processed at the time of the booking and transaction was recorded. By grouping the redemption PLU’s into different ‘Analysis Codes’, you can split sales and redemptions into different groups for reporting purposes. Please note: The above only relates to online bookings only. All “in-house” deposits (taken at a till) are processed by “Deposit Mode” only. “In-house” deposits may need to be a percentage or a set amount ahead of time to secure bookings. For this reason, only “Deposit Mode” can support taking a set amount as part payment, without needing to sell a fraction of a ticket to take a deposit and have an issue with rounding and how it would look on receipts and invoicing.",

    "title": "Analysis Codes",
    "text": "TABLE OF CONTENTS Introduction Analysis Code – Structure Example Analysis Code – Set Up Setting Up a 1st Tier Analysis Code Setting Up a 2nd Tier Analysis Code Setting Up a 3rd Tier Analysis Code Introduction ‘Analysis Codes’ are simply categories for sales reports, in which each of the items that you sell are allocated. This enables you to get sales reports by the ‘Analysis Codes’ you set up. Please note that ‘Analysis Codes’ are not set up for each item you sell, this is known as a PLU (Price Look Up). The process of setting up a PLU is outside the scope of this manual, as these are set up elsewhere in the MStore software. Please note that when you set up a PLU, it is assigned to a specific ‘Analysis Code’. This determines which ‘Analysis Code’ this PLU will report to in the relevant sales reports in the MStore software. An example of a key report which uses the analysis code structure is the ‘Daily Transaction Analysis’ report. An extract of this report is shown below so you can see how the analysis code set up affects your reports. The below data for simplicity shows data for a single 'Analysis Code' and the breakdown of item (PLU) sales within that. However when you run a report it will typically be showing data for all the 'Analysis Codes' selected by using the report filters. How to set up the ‘Analysis Codes’ that are used in specific sales (transaction based) reports is detailed in this guide. Analysis Code – Structure Example The ‘Analysis Codes’ structure can be set up as a one, two, or three tier (maximum) hierarchy. The number of tiers simply depends on your reporting requirements. An example of a simple one tier analysis code structure would be when you only want a split between ‘Hospitality’, ‘Admissions’ and ‘Retail’ sales. If you then need a more detailed break-down for your sales reports than just the first-tier analysis code, you can add a second tier to give the level of detail required. For example, if you wanted to get a report for ‘Admissions’ total sales but also want a breakdown from this into further categories (‘Analysis Codes’) for ‘Adults’, ‘Children’ and ‘Senior Citizens’, then these would be added as second-tier ‘Analysis Codes’ under ‘Admissions’. Likewise, if you need a further split of any second-tier analysis code you can add a third tier as required. Taking the above example, you may need to split the ‘Adults’ second-tier analysis code into categories for ‘Adult Single Tickets’ and ‘Adult Group Tickets’. In which case these would each be set up as a third tier under the ‘Adults’ analysis code. How to set up this tiered ‘Analysis Codes’ structure is detailed below. Analysis Code – Set Up To set up ‘Analysis Codes’ please 1. click on Setup then 2. click Pricing then 3. double click Analysis Codes. Please note that each analysis code must have a ‘code’ and a ‘description’. You can use any ‘Description’ you like (maximum 50 characters) but the ‘Code’ for each tier has a specific structure. An example of the three-tier hierarchy are shown below: 1st tier code structure: ## 2nd tier code structure ##-### 3rd tier code structure: ##-###-#### N.B. you must include the hyphen(s) ‘-‘ in a 2nd or 3rd tier code as shown above. Setting Up a 1st Tier Analysis Code Click on the text ‘Product Groups’ (at the top of the screen), so it becomes highlighted. Next click on the button here to add a new 1st tier analysis code. Now type in the required 2-digit code in the ‘Code:’ box. Next type in the required description for this analysis code in the ‘Short Desc:’ box. Click on the ‘Apply’ button to create the 1st tier analysis code. Repeat as required until all 1st tier ‘Analysis Codes’ have been set up. Setting Up a 2nd Tier Analysis Code To add a 2nd tier analysis code, click on the 1st tier analysis code you will add this new code under. (so that the required 1st tier analysis code is highlighted blue, e.g. ‘Admissions’). Next click on the button here to add a new 2nd tier analysis code. Now type in the required code in the ‘Code:’ box, which must be in the format ##-###. Next type in the required description for this analysis code in the ‘Short Desc:’ box. Click on the ‘Apply’ button to create the analysis code. Repeat as required until all 2nd tier ‘Analysis Codes’ have been set up. Setting Up a 3rd Tier Analysis Code You must first navigate to the required 2nd tier analysis code. To do this click on the ‘+’ symbol here so you can see the relevant 2nd tier analysis codes. To add a 3rd tier analysis code, click on the 2nd tier analysis code you will add this code under. N.B. the 'Analysis Code' that you clicked on should now become highlighted blue, e.g. ‘Admissions Adult’). Next click on the button here to add a new 3rd tier analysis code. Now type in the required code in the ‘Code:’ box, which must be in the format ##-###-####. Next type in the required description for this analysis code in the ‘Short Desc:’ box. Click on the ‘Apply’ button to create the analysis code. Repeat as required until all 3rd tier ‘Analysis Codes’ have been set up. Once all ‘Analysis Codes’ have been added, click on the ‘Close’ button. You would now repeat the processes to create all the 1st, 2nd and 3rd tier ' Analysis Codes' for the entire business. Please Note: The 'Analysis Codes' structure required for your business will not necessarily follow any of the sample structures detailed in the above screenshots. You will need to have internal discussions about proposed 'Analysis Codes' structure that is best for your business before implementing this, as this structure affects all future reporting. To re-structure this after you have gone live potentially requires a lot of work both in restructuring the 'Analysis Codes' but also you are likely to need to re-map all PLUs to the new ‘Analysis Codes’ structure. This can be done by using Setup > Pricing > Price Lookup Index to amend PLU records in the usual way. Send any changes to ‘Analysis Codes’ and PLUs to the tills using Edit > Recreate Till Data.",

    "text": "TABLE OF CONTENTS Introduction Finding the ‘New PLU/Stock Item Wizard ‘Type’ Screen ‘Price’ Screen ‘PLU Type’ Screen ‘Codes/Finish’ Screen Introduction This manual demonstrates creating ‘Admission Ticket’ PLU’s using the ‘New PLU/Stock Wizard’. Finding the ‘New PLU/Stock Item Wizard 1. Click on ‘Setup’ then 2. click ‘Pricing’ then 3. double click on the ‘New PLU/Stock Wizard’ icon. ‘Type’ Screen You will then see the following screen. Click on the circle to the left of the ‘Admission Ticket’ option. Now click on the ‘Next’ button. ‘Price’ Screen In the next screen click in the ‘Short description’ and enter the PLU description required. N.B. the ‘Short Description’ is the description that shown on the till and on receipts. We recommend that this description is limited to 20 characters and should not include any punctuation/special characters. Now click in the ‘Long Description’ box. You will notice the ‘Long Description’ box is automatically populated with the same information you typed in the ‘Short Description’ box. The ‘Long Description’ is used on the reports in the MStore back office software, so you can enter a longer description here if required. To do this click in the ‘Long Description’ box and amend the information as required. Once the required ‘Long Description’ has been entered you must now specify the ‘Pricing Type’. There are four different options: Allow: This allows the till operator to amend the price. Do Not Allow: This will not allow the till operator to amend the price. Force Price Entry: This will prompt the till operator to enter a price when selling the item. Embedded: this is where the price is embedded in a barcode (this isn’t normally used for admission PLU’s) In this specific example we have selected ‘Do not allow’. This option means the price of the PLU cannot be manually changed by anyone at the till. Now select the required ‘Analysis Code’ by clicking on the arrow to the right of the ‘Sales analysis code:’ box. If you have not yet set up the ‘Analysis Code’, you can do so by clicking the ‘Look up’ button. From the dropdown list that appears, click on the required ‘Analysis Code’ to select it. In the above example we selected the ‘Analysis Code’ called Admissions. Now select the required ‘VAT code’ by clicking on the arrow here. From the dropdown list that appears, select the ‘VAT code’ you require by clicking on it here. Now click in the ‘Sell Price (Inc Vat)’ field. Type in the required selling price for this PLU (e.g. £10.00 is entered as 10.00). If you offer gift aid on an admission ticket the price WITH gift aid should be entered here. Please note if the price without gift aid is lower, this price is entered after the PLU is created by editing it. Now you must select the ‘Price Valid from:’ and ‘Price Valid to:’ dates here as required. N.B. the default price validity is for 10 years from the date the PLU was created, but set these as required. To select the ‘Price Valid from:’ click on the arrow to the right of the field and the date selector appears. The ‘Price Valid from:’ is usually the date from which you want to start selling tickets for the event. But set this as required as the from / to dates determine when this item can be sold at the price specified. Click on the text for the year (e.g. click on 2025 at the top of the calendar), then use the up/down arrows to select the year. Click on the text for the month (e.g. click on January at the top of the calendar) and the month selector appears. Click on the required month name on the list that appears to select it. Then click on the date in the selected month. This selected date will now be showing in the the ‘Price Valid from:' field. Repeat the process to change the ‘Price valid to:’ date as required. This is often the last date you want to sell tickets for the event. In our example the tickets went on sale form 01/01/25 for an event that is on 06/07/2025. For some customers who have (i) integrations from MStore to 3rd party finance integrations, or (ii) that require to use reports in MStore that report transaction data by 3rd party finance system Nominal Codes, then these fields may be required. This will only work if nominal codes have been set up in advance in MStore. Setting up and mapping nominal codes it outside the scope of this guide, but if you need more information please contact your Account Manager. If these have been set up in MStore and need to be mapped to PLU level data, then there is the ability to select 2 nominal codes per PLU using the dropdowns shown if required. If not just leave these fields blank. Once the required price validity has been set as necessary, click on the ‘Next’ button. ‘PLU Type’ Screen If ‘Gift Aid’ is not to be claimed for this PLU, then leave this box un-ticked. If ‘Gift Aid’ is to be claimed for this PLU, then click in this box so a tick appears in it. If the ‘Gift Aid?’ box is ticked, you also need to specify whether you add an extra donation here This would be where the price WITH gift aid is HIGHER than the price WITHOUT gift aid. If so click the 'Add extra donation?' box, so it becomes ticked. N.B. at the till an online there is the ability to opt to gift aid or not gift aid and the price changes accordingly. Please note the \"without\" gift aid price is set up after the PLU is created in the Wizard, by editing the PLU. Now you must specify the footfall quantity that is to be recorded against this PLU as required. To do this click in the 'Footfall' box and type in the required footfall (as a number, e.g. 1). If a ticket is to be printed when this admission PLU is sold, then click on the arrow here. From the list of available ticket types that appears, click on the required ticket design to select it. Please not ticket designs need to be set up in advance but are outside the scope of this manual. In the 'Number per ticket' field enter the number of tickets that were printed when this PLU was sold (e.g. 1). N.B. there are other fields in this screen but in this guide we are just covering the basic tickets requirements. Now click on the ‘Next’ button to continue. ‘Codes/Finish’ Screen At the following screen type in the code you require for this admission PLU here. For all the admission ticket PLU’s, you must create your own unique PLU ‘Code’ for each PLU. Please use an alpha-numeric code when creating your own codes for PLU’s. Decide on your own PLU coding system and ensure that all people entering new PLU’s use the same PLU coding system. Type in the code for this PLU here as required, in this example we chose to use the code “ADSE1”. Once you have typed in the required code, then click on the ‘Add’ button here. Next click on the ‘Finish’ button to finish adding this PLU. You will then see the following screen. Now click on the ‘OK’ button. You now know how to add ‘Admission Ticket’ PLU’s in the MStore back office software. Please ensure you send any new data to your tills in the usual way, using Edit > Recreate Till Data.",

    "title": "Price Breaks",
    "text": "TABLE OF CONTENTS Introduction Assigning a Price Break to a PLU Updating In-House Prices Updating Internet Prices Introduction ‘Price Breaks’ are a way of setting up price changes to occur on specific dates. Many of our customers use this functionality for setting up all the new admission ticket prices a month in advance of the start of a new season. Applying ‘Price Breaks’ in this way, will ensure the tills, or the internet prices (for customers who have purchased the ‘Online Bookings’ module) already have, and automatically use the new price from the first day of the new season. Although often used for changes to admission ticket prices, price breaks can equally be used to set up scheduled price changes for PLU’s sold in the retail, or hospitality environments. The process of creating and applying ‘Price Breaks’ is explained in this manual. Assigning a Price Break to a PLU The first step in adding a ‘Price Break’ is to find the PLU. To do this 1. Click on ‘Setup’, 2. click ‘Pricing’, 3. double click on ‘Price Lookup Index’. Use any of the search options to find the PLU that requires updating in the usual way. In this example as the code was known, this was just entered into the ‘Scan/Enter Code:’ field. The ‘Search’ button was then clicked to bring up the list of PLU’s found (in this case just one PLU). Double click on the PLU record that you want to add a ‘Price Break’ to. Once in the PLU Maintenance screen, click on the ‘View/Add Price’ button. Please as this PLU has the gift aid setting to enable the price with (higher) and (lower) without gift aid to be entered. N.B. the 'Pricing Details' grid does vary depending on whether or not gift aid settings have been applied to the PLU. In the ‘Price History’ screen, the current prices and any ‘Price Breaks’ that have already been set up will be shown. In the example below, the current price is set to £7 with gift aid and £6.30 without gift aid. But a there is going to be a price change so we need needs to apply new prices to this PLU for a different date range (a 'Price Break'). The process of creating a new ‘Price Break’ is explained below. Before changing the price, the date that the current price ends on must be set correctly, as overlapping the end and start dates causes problems and must be avoided! To do this, click on the down arrow next to ‘Valid To’, then the calendar to select an end date for the current price. To select a new year click on the year (at the top of the calendar) and use the up/down arrows to select the required year. Next click on the month and a pop up appears, click the required month. Finally, click the date on the calendar that the price ends on. Once the new ‘Valid To’ date has been selected, click on the ‘Apply’ button. The ‘Valid To’ date in the ‘Pricing History’ window on the right shows as updated. To enter the new prices click on the ‘New’ Icon (the blank sheet of paper) where shown. Now enter the new 'Inhouse Prices' and ‘Internet Prices’ as required. Please as this PLU has the gift aid setting to enable the price with (higher) and (lower) without gift aid to be entered. N.B. the 'Pricing Details' grid does vary depending on whether or not gift aid settings have been applied to the PLU. Next set the start and end dates for the new price (ensuring these do not overlap with the previous price). Do this by clicking on the down arrows next to the ‘Valid From’ date and ‘Valid To’ date and select the new dates required. When the new price, dates and VAT rate have been set as required, click on ‘Apply’. A new line appears in the ‘Pricing History’ window with the new details. To exit this screen, click ‘Close’. At the next screen (the ‘PLU Maintenance’ window), click ‘Close’. At the next screen (the ‘Prices Index’ window), click ‘Close’. Updating In-House Prices The process of updating the “in-house” prices is by carrying out the ‘Recreate Till Data’ process. This is done in the usual way, which is: Click on 1. ‘Edit’ then 2. ‘Recreate Till Data’ At this point we usually recommend sending to all tills, by clicking ‘Apply’. At the “Till data recreated successful!” message, click ‘Ok’. You can expand the ‘Departments and Tills’ tree in the usual way (by clicking the ‘+’ symbol). Then you could select / deselect tills as required, by right clicking them before clicking ‘Apply’. However, we do not usually recommend this, as this could lead to different tills having different prices. Updating Internet Prices To update the 'Internet Prices' entered so the relevant K3 e-commerce pages (for those customers who have purchased these modules) then first you need to access the K3 Online Admin Page. To access this page in the MStore software: 1. click on ‘Setup’, 2. then click ‘Bookings’ and then 3. double click ‘Booking Templates’. Next click on the 'Website Login' button. This will now open your default internet browser to access your specific admin menu page URL. You will need to ensure your computer has a working internet connection and your preferred web browser software is installed. Your ‘Windows User Account’ must not have any restrictions that would prevent internet access or browsing. Your own IT department or external IT support team will need to assist if you have any issues accessing the internet, as K3 are not responsible for supporting or enabling access to the internet. If there are no internal IT restrictions, you should see the your online ‘Admin Menu’ login page. Enter the password you have been supplied in the relevant box and click the 'Login' button. Next click the 'Update Templates' button and wait for the update to complete. Your web page updates have been sent (please note these updates can take up to 5 minutes to reach your web pages) You can now log off the 'Admin Page' by clicking the 'Logout' button at the bottom of the screen.",

To begin using the ‘Promotion Wizard’ we must first locate it within the MStore back office software. To open the ‘Promotion Wizard’ click on 1. ‘Setup’, then 2. ‘Pricing’ then 3. double click ‘Promotion Wizard’. 'Type' Screen This section will explain each of the promotion types that can be set up using the ‘Promotion Wizard’, before moving onto the next phase of entering the promotion details. There are three types of promotions that can be created using the ‘Promotion Wizard’, these are: ‘Discount’ Promotions. ‘Multi-Buy’ Promotions. ‘Basket’ Promotions. The ‘Type’ screen displays each of the three types of promotions There is also a brief description of how each promotion type works. The above promotion types are explained in the following pages. Discount Promotion A 'Discount' type promotion can be used to apply the following types of discounts to specified PLU’s: Price reduction by a specified percentage on a PLU(s). Price reduction by a specified amount on a PLU(s). Specific price on a PLU(s). A 'Discount' type promotion can be triggered during a transaction and can fire in the following ways: Everyone/Members/Staff/Managers/Account/Selected The above ways of triggering the promotion are referred to as the ‘Promotion Eligibility’ and are covered later in this guide N.B. for ‘Selected’ promotions you can specify ‘Promotion Conditions’ which must be met in order for the promotion to fire. These conditions specify the quantity of other PLU’s that must be sold before the promotion fires, e.g. you must by two ‘Adult Admission’ PLU’s before you can get 100% discount off a ‘Child Admission’ PLU. Setting up ‘Promotion Conditions’ are covered later. To select this promotion type, click in the circle to the left of the ‘Discount’ text. Once you have selected the promotion type, click on the ‘Next’ button. Now go to Section 2 of this guide. Multi Buy Promotion Multi-Buy promotions are designed to discount a single item when one or more of that same item has been scanned or entered into the till basket. For example, imagine a café has excess stock of Mars bars and they want to setup a “buy two get one free” promotion on Mars bars. In this example the till software will automatically apply the discount but only if there are three Mars bars in the till basket. This is because the promotion conditions are not met until all three Mars bars have been entered or scanned into the till basket. To select this promotion type, simply click in the circle to the left of the ‘Multi-Buy’ text. Once you have selected the promotion type, click on the ‘Next’ button. Now go to Section 2 of this guide. Basket Promotion Basket promotions are designed to discount a single item only after another item (or a group of items) have been scanned or entered into the till. For example, a café wants to setup a promotion that discounts a cup of tea by 100% for any customer that orders a breakfast with that cup of tea. In this example the till software will automatically apply the discount but only if both the breakfast and tea are in the till’s basket. This is because the promotion conditions are not met until both the breakfast and tea are in the till’s basket. To select this promotion type, simply click in the circle to the left of the ‘Basket’ text. Once you have selected the promotion type, click on the ‘Next’ button. 'Description' Screen Now that we have covered the three types of promotions available, we can move onto the next step in creating our promotion. The ‘Description’ screen of the promotion wizard has the following sections Promotion Description Fields. Promotion Group. Promotion Eligibility. Each of the above sections of this screen are explained in the following pages, The location of each of these sections is shown below. Key: (1) Promotion Description fields. (2) ‘Promotion Eligibility’ options. (3) ‘Promotion Group’ selection (drop-down). (4) ‘Promotion Group’ “Lookup” Icon. Promotion 'Description' Fields Once we’ve chosen a promotion type, we will need to provide a detailed ‘Description’ as well as a ‘Short Description’ for the promotion being set up. It is important to use descriptions that are easy to understand because they will be used in various places throughout the MStore back office software and when using the till software The ‘Description Field’ will show in the relevant reports in MStore back office software. The ‘Short Description’ field is the description printed on receipts and on the till’s rear display (if present). Type in the required text in the ‘Description’ box. Type in the required text ‘Short Description’ box. Click on the ‘Next’ button once finished to proceed to the next step. Promotion Eligibility Promotion eligibility is crucial in determining how our promotion will work and unsurprisingly who will be eligible for our promotion. By default, every promotion is set with an eligibility of ‘Everyone’, this means all items associated with this promotion will be automatically discounted when it is scanned into the till basket. The major difference between the ‘Everyone’ promotion eligibility type and all the others is that all other eligibility types require the promotion to be activated by a till operator. Meaning the till operator is required to do something that activates the promotion they wish to use (i.e. either press a button on the till or scan a coupon). Please note that if you are setting up a ‘Multi-buy; or ‘Basket’ type promotion, then the promotion eligibility will default to ‘Everyone’ and cannot be changed. For a ‘Discount’ type promotion you must click in the circle to the left of the required option to select it. Each of these promotion eligibility options are explained on the following page. Once you the required ‘Promotion Eligibility’ is selected, click the ‘Next’ button to proceed. Everyone: This discount will be activated automatically when an item meeting the promotion requirements is added to the basket. Members: This promotion eligibility can automatically apply a discount when a member card is swiped or scanned at the till. Please note that this membership promotion will not function unless it has been assigned to the specific membership type(s) that this discount will apply to. Staff: This type of promotion is fired by pressing a specific button on the till. Please note that setting up till buttons is not covered in this manual but for your information the button that fires this promotion must be set up as a ‘Command’ button action, then select the ‘Staff Sale’ option from the drop-down list. Please note that only one staff discount scheme can be in operation on your tills at any time (on some versions). The specific staff discount scheme must be defined in the MStore back office software in the ‘System Options’ screen. This is found in Setup > System > System Options - under the ‘Accounting’ tab Managers: This type of promotion is fired by pressing a specific button on the till. Please note that setting up till buttons is not covered in this manual but for your information the button that fires this promotion must be set up as a ‘Command’ button action, then select the ‘Manager Sale’ option from the drop-down list. Please note that only one manager’s discount scheme can be in operation on your tills at any time (on some versions). this must be defined in the MStore back office software in the ‘System Options’ screen. This is found in Setup > System > System Options - under the ‘Accounting’ tab Selected: This type of promotion must be fired by pressing a specific button on the till (or by scanning a coupon that has a barcode on it that will trigger the promotion). Please note that setting up till buttons is not covered in this manual but for your information the button that fires this promotion must be set up as a ‘Promotion’ button action, then select the required ‘Promotion Scheme’ and ‘Promotion Coupon’ from the relevant drop-down lists. Promotion Group Each promotion you create must be assigned to a Promotion Group. If a promotion group is not assigned to a promotion, then the discounted items will not be shown in the relevant reports. To set a promotion group we can choose from one of the default groups listed within the drop-down menu, or we can create a unique promotion group by selecting the “Lookup” icon. Key: (1) ‘Promotion Group’ selection (drop-down). (2) ‘Promotion Group’ “Lookup” Icon. 'Details' Screen The Promotion Details screen is where we will configure the discount details for all items we wish to include in this promotion. You may notice the ‘Product Groups’ have the same code and description as our ‘Analysis Codes’. This is because they are indeed the same, i.e. ‘Product Groups’ = ‘Analysis Codes’. Key: (1) Analysis Codes. (2) ‘Discount Type’ selection. (3) Discount percentage / amount entry field. Discount Percentage This discount type reduces an item or group of items by a percentage. Click on a product group in the left side of the screen to select that product group. The right side of the screen will now populate with all items within the selected product group. If we want to apply unique discount values to every item, we must select each item individually, then enter an amount in the discount value field and click the ‘Apply’ button. Repeat as required until all items have the correct discount percentage assigned to them. Alternatively, we can click in the ‘Apply to all items in this view’ box so that this is ticked, then click on the ‘Apply’ button. This will apply the discount value to all items within the selected ‘Product Group’. Repeat as required until all the product groups have the correct discount percentage assigned to them. Once all the promotion discounts have been assigned to the item(s) as required, click the ‘Next’ button. Key: (1) Admissions product group. (2) Item showing a discount (15% discount). (3) ‘Discount Percentage’ type selected. (4) ‘Percentage’ discount amount entry field. Reduce By A ‘Reduce By’ type promotion will reduce an item by a set value (e.g. £1.00). The same instructions apply as previously detailed for applying the discount to an item(s) within a product group or applying the discount to an entire product group. Once all the promotion discounts have been assigned to the item(s) as required, click the ‘Next’ button. Key: (1) Admissions product group. (2) Item showing a discount (‘Reduce By’ £4). (3) ‘Reduce By’ type selected. (4) ‘Reduce By’ amount entry field. Promotion Price The 'Promotion Price' discount type is used to set the promotional price of an item. The same instructions apply as in the previous section for applying the discount to an item(s) within a product group or to an entire product group. Once all the promotion discounts have been assigned to the item(s) as required, click the ‘Next’ button. Key: (1) Selected product group. (2) Item showing a discount (‘Special Price’ £12.50). (3) ‘Promotion Price’ type selected. (4) ‘Promotion Price’ entry field. Promotion Conditions The 'Promotion Conditions' screen allows us to specify the number of items that must be purchased in order to enable our promotion. By default, only one item must be purchased to trigger any promotion. Amend the ‘Qualifying Quantity’ (refer to description on the screen) as required for the promotion you are setting up. Now click on the ‘Next’ button to proceed. Key: (1) ‘Qualifying Quantity’ number selection. Promotion Dates/Times This is where we will set the date and time parameters for our new promotion. The first step for setting these parameters is to select a date range. Selecting a date range can be done two different ways: Selecting ‘Valid From’ / ‘Valid To’ Dates. Selecting a Calendar. Once the dates have been specified you can then also specify on which day(s) of the week and at which times of the day the promotion will work using the ‘Day and Times’ settings. Key: (1) ‘Valid From’ / ‘Valid To’ date selectors. (2) ‘Use a Calendar’ tick box. (3) ‘Days and Times’ settings. Important: It is important to remember that both the ‘Valid From’ / ‘Valid To’ dates and the ‘Days and Times’ settings must be configured appropriately. By default, the ‘Promotion Wizard’ will have all days and times of the week selected. If the promotion must only work on certain days this must be specified in the ‘Days and Times’ settings. Valid To/From Dates Using the ‘Valid From’ and ‘Valid To’ drop-down menus is the easiest way to select the required start and end date for the promotion. Clicking the drop-down menu icons will pop-up a small calendar window that allows the user to select the date(s) rather than manually typing them. Select the ‘Valid From’ and ‘Valid To’ dates as required, then click the ‘Next’ button. Important: Remember that this date range determines when this promotion will be start and end, so be sure to select the correct dates! Using a Calendar Using a calendar is very helpful if we already have a calendar period setup in within the back office software. If a calendar has already been set up then we can simply select the ‘Use a Calendar?’ check box and then select the appropriate calendar period from the drop-down menu. However, if we don’t have a calendar period setup already then we can create our own by using the ‘Lookup’ icon next to the calendar drop-down menu. Select the required calendar then click the ‘Next’ button. Key: (1) ‘Use a Calendar’ check-box. (2) Calendar selection (drop-down) and “Lookup” icon. Days and Time Settings This section of the ‘Dates/Times’ screen of the wizard is used to apply our discount to specific days of the week and times of the day. By default every day of the week is selected, so you will notice you the tick box to the left of each day is ticked. You can deselect a day of the week by clicking in the box to the left of that required day, so that it becomes un-ticked. This will mean the promotion will not be active on that day of the week. By default you will also notice that for any day where the promotion is active the promotion ‘Start Time’ and ‘End Time’ cannot be changed. If you want change the start and end times for a promotion then you first need to click in the ‘All Day’ box next to the required day of the week so that it becomes un-ticked. You can now change the start and end time of the promotion to be as required by either typing in the required times (use the 24 hour clock format), or using the up and down arrows to increase or decrease the hours or minutes as required. Key: (1) Day and Times Settings. Once all the required data has been enter click the 'Finish' button to save and add the promotion. Editing Promotions The Wizard is only used to add new promotions. To check / amend a promotion you need to go into the 'Promotions' screen. To open the ‘Promotions’ click on 1. ‘Setup’, then 2. ‘Pricing’ then 3. double click ‘Promotions’. You would then need to first select the 'Promotion Type' of the promotion you want to find. Then select the required promotion 'Description' to edit. Please not all the fields you saw in the Wizard can be found on this screen. But please note where the Wizard had screens then some of this content has a button to view it For example the 'Details' button needs to be clicked to set up the promotion on each PLU/Analysis Code as required. Click 'Apply' once any changes are made. Then click 'Close' and remember to update your tills (Edit > Recreate Till Data) to send any promotion changes to your tills.",

    "text": "TABLE OF CONTENTS Introduction Creating Non-Stocked Items Setting Up PLU’s that will be Order Options Setting up PLU’s that have Order Options Setting Up ‘Default’ Order Options Sending PLU’s to Kitchen Printers How Order Options Work on the Till Introduction The following document is designed for use in catering environments and covers: Setting up PLU’s for your various ‘Order Options’ (e.g. meal choices such as chips or salad). Setting up PLU’s to have a choice of ‘Order Options’ when sold (including ‘Default’ order options). How to define the kitchen printer a PLU will be sent to. How order screens look and work on the till itself. Please Note: The prerequisite for using this manual is to already have received training on and know how to: Use the ‘New PLU/Stock Wizard’. Use the ‘Price Lookup Index’ to add / find and edit PLU’s (including the ‘PLU Maintenance’ screen). Creating Non-Stocked Items In catering environments, meals that require various options to be selected and sent to the kitchen printer would usually be set up as a ‘Non Stocked Item’. This is because you do not hold e.g. ‘Fish and Chips’ in stock. This is a meal that is cooked to order when it is sent to the kitchen printer, so all meals that are cooked to order would usually be set up as a ‘Non-Stocked Item’ in the MStore software. Likewise, any ‘Order Options’ would be set up as a ‘Non-Stocked Item’. For example, with a main course you may get a choice of either chips, or jacket, or boiled potatoes, each of these would be set up as a ‘Non-Stocked Item’. Likewise, any other cooking instructions that need to be sent to a kitchen printer (e.g. Well Done, Medium, Rare, No Onion, No Nuts etc) would each be set up as a ‘Non-Stocked Item’. The first steps of setting up any ‘Non-Stocked Item’ are detailed below: 1. Click on the ‘Setup’ main menu button. 2.Next click on the ‘Pricing’ button. 3. Now double click the ‘New PLU/Stock Wizard’ button. Select the ‘Non-Stocked Item’ option and then click the ‘Next’ button. You will now see the following screen. First set up all your order option / cooking instructions PLU’s (see below). Setting Up PLU’s that will be Order Options Enter the details in the below screen as required. In the below example ‘No onion’ will be a choice (‘Order Option’) that has no (£0.00) price. Alternatively, an ‘Order Option’ could have a price, e.g. ‘Extra Cheese’ could be £1.00. Enter all the details as required then click the ‘Next’ button. You will now see the following screen. Click the box to the right of the text ‘This is a food item’, so that it becomes ticked. Now click the box to the right of the text ‘Order option item:’, so that it becomes ticked. Once the correct options have been selected click the ‘Next’ button. You will now see the following screen. Enter the required code in the ‘Code / Barcode:’ box, then click the ‘Add’ button. Next click the ‘Finish’ button. You will now see the following message. Click the ‘OK’ button. Repeat the process to create all the zero priced and priced order option PLU’s as required. Setting up PLU’s that have Order Options The following section details how to set up a meal that will have order options, in the example below we will set up the ‘Fish and Chips’ ‘Non Stocked Item’ PLU and show you how to add the ‘Order Option’ PLU’s it requires. Select the ‘Non-Stocked Item’ option and then click the ‘Next’ button. Enter all the details as required then click the ‘Next’ button You will now see the following screen. Now click the box to the right of the text ‘This is a food item:’, so this becomes ticked. Now click the box to the right of the text ‘Kitchen order item:’, so this becomes ticked. Also click the box to the right of the text ‘Order Options’, so this becomes ticked. Once the correct options have been selected click the ‘Next’ button. Enter the required code in the ‘Code / Barcode:’ box, then click the ‘Add’ button. Next click the ‘Finish’ button. You will now see the following message. Click the ‘OK’ button. You will now see the message below, click ‘Yes’ to add the relevant order options. You will now see the following screen. The list of order option item PLU’s you have already created will now show on the left-hand side. You can click and drag the required order option PLU's from the left, to the right-hand side of the screen. This creates the required list of options that will appear when selling this item on the till. To create an “either/or” click and drag the required order option items ABOVE the red line. N.B. the options will appear on the till in exactly the same order that they are added, so please ensure you click and drag the options in the required order. If an order option(s) are in the wrong order, they will need to be deleted and re-added in the correct order. To delete an option from the right-hand side of the screen, click on the item (so it becomes highlighted yellow) then press the ‘Delete’ button on your computer’s QWERTY keyboard. The item will now be removed from the list of selected order options. In the below screen an “either / or” choice has been created. If you want to create a second “either / or” choice, double click ON the red line. This will create a second section ABOVE the red line (as indicated by the arrow above) You will notice that the start of the new section is indicated by a blue line. Simply drag your second choice of order options PLU’s from the left-hand list into this new section. (i.e. you would drag the order option items BETWEEN the blue line and the red line). If required, double click the red line again to create a third section of “either / or” choices. N.B. you can only create a maximum of 8 sections of “either / or” choices above the red line. In this scenario it has been decided that the following “either / or” choices only are required: (i) the first choice will be either ‘White Bread’ or ‘Brown Bread’. (ii) the second choice of either ‘Peas’ or Beans’. If so, then the right-hand side of the screen would be set up to look like the example shown below. Please note that in addition you can also have only one “any of” choice. This is done by dragging order option PLU’s from the list on the left-hand side, but these need to be dragged BELOW the red line on the right hand side of the screen. On the till this means you would be able to select “any of” the items (showing below the red line) Setting Up ‘Default’ Order Options If required, you can also set ‘Default’ order options. These ‘Default’ order options will be automatically selected on the relevant order options screen that is displayed on the till. If you do not want any ‘Default’ choice (i.e. the till operator must ask the customer before selecting the relevant options), then simply do not set up any ‘Default’ choice on the order options. The ‘Default’ order options can be seen and defined here. A ‘Default’ choice can be switched on / off as required. To turn a ‘Default’ choice on, first click in the box next to the required order option item. Next press the ‘Y’ key on your computer keyboard. To turn a ‘Default’ off, first click in the box next to the required order option item. Next press the ‘N’ key on your computer keyboard. Once all the options have been set up as required, click the ‘Save’ button. You will now see the following message. Click the ‘OK’ button. You have now set up the required order options. Please ensure that you send all the changes down to the till(s) via Edit > Recreate Till Data. Sending PLU’s to Kitchen Printers For items that need to be sent to a kitchen printer only, the required set up is detailed below. For example, a ‘White Coffee’ PLU when sold does not have any order options, but needs to be sent to a kitchen printer near the drink preparation area. This would be an example where it is sent to the kitchen printer only. As explained in the previous sections, create a new ‘Non-Stocked Item’ and fill out the below screen. In this scenario simply click the box to the right of the text ‘Kitchen Order Item’, so that it becomes ticked. Click the ‘Next’ button to continue. Enter the required code in the ‘Code / Barcode:’ box. Next click the ‘Add’ button (and the code you entered appears where shown and is highlighted yellow) Click the ‘Finish’ button. You will now see the following screen, which confirms the non-stocked item has been added. Click the ‘Ok’ button. Please note that when you add a PLU using the ‘New PLU/Stock Wizard’ and you tick the ‘Kitchen Order Item’ box, as standard this PLU will be automatically set to send to ‘Kitchen Printer 1’. In the scenario where there is more than one compatible kitchen printer installed and available, then you may need to find the PLU and select the required kitchen printer as detailed below: Go into SETUP > PRICING > PRICE LOOKUP INDEX. Search for and open the required PLU record, so you are in the ‘PLU Maintenance’ screen (below). Select the required kitchen printer this PLU will be sent to. N.B. you can select the PLU to send to, either: ‘Kitchen Printer 1’, ‘Kitchen Printer 2’, ‘Kitchen Printer 3’ or ‘All Kitchen Printers’ as required. Click ‘Save’. Now you must send all the changes down to the tills as usual, via Edit > Recreate Till Data. Next, we recommend you go to the till(s) and thoroughly test all the order options are working correctly. The order options screens on the till are detailed in the next section of this manual. How Order Options Work on the Till On pressing the button to sell a PLU that has order options, you will see a screen like the one below. You will notice that ‘Default’ order options are already selected and are highlighted green. You can select an alternative “either / or” choice by simply pressing / clicking on the required option. You will notice that in the above example an additional order option of ‘No bread’ and ‘No Peas or Beans’ have been added, which will appear on the print outs sent to the kitchen printer. This may be something that you want to set up, if so these are just set up as order option PLU’s. For the “any of” order option choices, simply press / click on these to toggle the choice on / off. You can also enter a ‘Table Number’ and number of ‘Covers’ in the relevant boxes as required. There is also a box in which free text notes can be entered using the QWERTY keyboard. These notes will also be sent to the kitchen printer along with the order options that were selected. Click the ‘Ok’ button and complete the transaction to the required payment method in the usual way. The items will be sent to the relevant kitchen printer(s) as defined in the PLU setting detailed earlier. Please Note: For this to work it does require kitchen printers to have been purchased from and installed by K3. Once installed these need to be assigned to the required tills in the background. Then each till can send to the kitchen printers it is connected / networked to, there can be a maximum of 3 printers per till. But the PLU setting determines which kitchen printer the item gets sent to (kitchen printer 1, 2,3 or all of them). If you want to enquire about having kitchen printers.",

    "text": "TABLE OF CONTENTS Introduction Adding Data Capture to a PLU Selecting the PLU that Requires Data Capture The Data Capture Window Data Type: Capture Prompt Frequency Rules: Adding Data Capture to a PLU Text Capture: Numeric Capture Option List Capture Yes or No Capture Email Capture Online Booking Capture Viewing Captured Data Introduction When selling a PLU or when booking a specific ‘Bookable Resource’, data capture can be used to record additional information that may be required. This could be information such as the nationality of anyone buying an admission ticket at the till, or the age of a child for a ‘Visit Santa’ booking made online. Adding Data Capture to a PLU Selecting the PLU that Requires Data Capture The first step is to find the PLU you wish to add ‘Data Capture’ to: 1. click the ‘Setup’ icon. 2. click the ‘Pricing’ icon. 3 double click the ‘Price Lookup Index’ icon. Find the required PLU using the ‘Prices Index’ in the usual way by entering the search criteria and click 'Search'. Double-click on the required PLU in the 'Search Results' section (bottom half) of the screen. This will open the ‘PLU Maintenance’ window. Click the ‘Add/View Data Capture’ button. The Data Capture Window Data Type: Per PLU you can set a maximum of 5 data capture questions. There are seven “data types” that you can use. These are outlined within the ‘Data Type’ dropdown menu. The 7 data capture 'Types' are detailed below. Text: Prompting for a custom text response. (For example: on birthday bookings you may wish to capture the birthday child’s name) Numeric: Prompts for a numeric input. (For example: to capture ages) Yes/No: Prompts for a yes or no response. (For example: on an online day ticket booking you may ask “Do you want a free guidebook”) Photo: Prompts to capture a photo at point of sale. Option List: Prompts the customer to select an option on the list. (For example: how did you hear about us? Option: 1.Internet 2., TV advert, etc.) Postcode: Prompts to capture a postcode. (used mainly for marketing purposes) Email Address: Prompts to capture an email address. Capture Prompt Frequency Rules: These tick box fields control the data capture behaviour at point of sale. Prompt once per transaction: The data capture will trigger once per transaction only. (regardless of the quantity of this specific PLU are in the basket). Prompt once per unique PLU: The data capture will trigger for each unique (non-duplicate) PLU in the basket. Prompt for each Sales Line: The data capture will fire the number of times this specific PLU is in the basket. Inactive: This option can inactivate the specific data capture question. This question then will then not show in the top half of the above screen, unless the tick box marked ‘Show Inactive?’ is ticked (by clicking the box). Response mandatory: A response must be given to this specific data request to be able to complete transaction. Internet only: All data capture defaults to working at on the till only, this tick box limits the capture to only trigger for online sales of the specified PLU. Please Note: If you want a data capture prompt to appear on both the till and for online sales you would need to create two data capture questions, one with ‘Internet Only’ box ticked. Adding Data Capture to a PLU For this example, using the ‘Santa Grotto PLU’ we’re going to capture: Name of the child: (Data Type: Text) Age of the child: (Data Type: Numeric) Child’s gender: (Data Type: Option List) Do you want a photo: (Data Type: Yes or No) If so, the contact email address where the photo will be sent to: (Data Type: Email) The following sections of the manual show how these would be set up to work on the till. The manual shows in detail what each capture method looks like on the till screen. In the Section 2.4 ‘Online Booking Capture’ there is an image of how data the capture questions appear online. Text Capture: Click ‘New’. Input the prompt text, e.g. what is the child’s name? Using the ‘Data Type’ dropdown, select ‘Text’ Select ‘Prompt once per unique PLU’. Click ‘Apply’ When you sell the item on the till, this is what shows on screen: Numeric Capture Click ‘New’. Using the Data Type dropdown, select ‘Numeric’ Click ‘Apply’ Input the prompt text, e.g. how old is the child? Select ‘Prompt once per unique PLU’. Click ‘Apply’ When you sell the item on the till, this is what shows on screen for this data capture: Option List Capture Click ‘New’. Using the ‘Data Type’ dropdown, select ‘Option List’ Click ‘Apply’. Input the prompt text, e.g. Gender? Select ‘Prompt once per unique PLU’. Input your first option in ‘Add new option’ field (refer to the next page **). Now click the ‘>>’ button. Repeat from the above point (** see page 9) until all options show in the option list as required. (only two options have been added purely for demonstration purposes). Click ‘Apply’. When you sell the item on the till, this is what shows on screen for this data capture: Yes or No Capture Click ‘New’. Using the ‘Data Type’ dropdown, select ‘Yes/No’. Click ‘Apply’. Input prompt text, e.g. Souvenir Photo? Select ‘Prompt once per unique PLU’. Select ‘Response Mandatory’ tick box. Click ‘Apply’. When you sell the item on the till, this is what shows on screen for this data capture: Email Capture Click ‘New’. Using the ‘Data Type’ dropdown, select ‘Email’. Click ‘Apply’. Input the prompt text, e.g. Email address? Select ‘Prompt once per unique PLU’. Click ‘Apply’. When you sell the item on the till, this is what shows on screen for this data capture: Please note data captured in the booking would land in the 'Diary' screen in MStore. Viewing this data is detailed in Section 3 below. Online Booking Capture Please not online data capture is only available to customers who have purchased the relevant ecommerce modules. This is just an example of what the five data captures 'Types' demonstrated in this guide appear like online in a booking. When the ‘Bookable Resource’ is added to the basket the questions pop up as shown below. Any data captured in the booking would land in the 'Diary' screen in MStore and viewing this data is detailed below. Viewing Captured Data Data captured when making a booking appears within the ‘Bookings’ screen for a specific booking. The easiest way to get view a booking is by 1. clicking 'Diary' then 2. click 'Find Bk'. Enter the booking reference in the 'Booking Ref:' field and click 'Search' is the best way to find the booking. If yuo do not have this use other search criteria and click 'Search'. Double click any booking that is found (in the bottom half of the screen) to open the booking record. In the ‘Bookings’ screen, double-click any resource which had captured data. Please note you can see at a glance whether the specific booking has any data capture. Any booking with data capture will have a green bar as shown above, which says: “Double click items below to review responses to data capture questions” The data will be displayed as shown below. If you wish to remove a captured data record, click on it so it becomes highlighted. Press the ‘Delete’ button on your computer keyboard. A message pops up saying, “Delete Selected Record?”. Click the ‘Yes’ button. If you wish to amend the captured data, simply double-click on any line in the above screen. A new window will then pop-up as shown below, in which you can amend / overtype the data. Enter / amend / overtype the data as required and click ‘Ok’. Repeat the process to amend / overtype / delete any other captured data records. Ensure you click the ‘Save Booking’ button to save the changes made.",

The ‘Memberships Module’ in the MStore back office software allows you to first set up the various ‘Membership Types’ that you require. The set-up of ‘Membership Types’ includes information on the duration of each membership, how long that membership type will be valid for, and the prices and fees associated with that membership scheme. When a memberships is purchased a card is issued which can then be scanned or swiped (depend on the card type and till hardware purchased) to allow member cards to be validated and admitted quickly when they return. This process will also record footfall and member visit history. Please Note: There are three chargeable modules that are outside of the scope of this manual, that can work in conjunction with the ‘Memberships Module’. For more details and to obtain a quote for any of these modules please contact your Account Manager. The modules are listed below: Direct Debits Module Online Memberships Module GDPR Module There are three further modules that are provided in the MStore software as standard, that work in conjunction with the ‘Memberships Module’. If you need any training or consultancy on using these other modules, please contact your Account Manager for a quote for this training. The modules are listed below: Promotions Module Loyalty Module Adoptions Module Although not covered in this manual, as standard there is reporting on memberships and these can be found in the ‘Reports’ main menu option in MStore (as long as your user is in a ‘Security Group’ that has been given access to these by the person in your business responsible for maintaining ‘Users’ and ‘Security Groups’). Please view these reports to see the information contained. Membership Types Memberships can be seen and set up by: 1. Clicking the ‘Setup’ icon. 2. Then clicking on the ‘Customer’ icon. 3. Finally, double clicking on ‘Membership Types’. The ‘Memberships/Privilege Schemes’ window is made up of two main parts: 1. ‘Privilege Schemes’: This lists all the different membership types created. 2. ‘Scheme details’: This shows all details and setup of the membership types. Adding a New Membership Type To create a new ‘Membership Type’, click on the ‘New’ button. By clicking ‘New’ most of the boxes in the ‘Scheme Details’ section are now cleared, this means we can start setting up a new ‘Membership Type’. For our example we will setup a ‘Child Membership'. The first step is to add a ‘Code’ and ‘Description’. These can be alpha-numeric and will be used to identify the ‘Membership Type’. For information purposes you can select the membership 'Group' this membership type belongs to. For example you might have 'Family' and 'Corporate' membership, so you can add a 'Group' name to each membership type. You can set up these as required by clicking on the glasses icon to the right of 'Group' dropdown. To add new ones, click button to add a new Membership 'Group' (or click File >New). Enter a 'Code' and 'Description' for each group, click 'Apply' then 'Close'. ‘Duration’ The next box in the ‘Scheme Details’ section is ‘Duration’. This field determines how long the membership lasts for once it’s purchased. This is defined using the number box and the ‘Duration’ dropdown. Using a combination of these two we can easily setup any length duration required. For example, the duration can easily be set to either 1 Year, 6 Months, 12 Weeks, etc. Scheme Valid From/Until This controls the date range between which the membership scheme is valid. This is very important as it effects both the cut off for selling the membership and the end date for the members already on the scheme. This is simply defined by selecting the ‘Scheme Valid From:’ and ‘Scheme Valid Until:’ dates using the drop-down calendar selectors where shown below. In the calendar the year can increased/decreased by clicking on the text for the year, then click the up/down arrows. If you click on the month text, then a list of the months appears and click the required one. Finally, select the date by clicking the required date for the month selected. Alternatively if you click directly in the 'Scheme Valid From' or 'Scheme Valid To' boxes, you can enter the date directly. Click on the year text and enter the required year in 'YYYY' format (e.g. 2049) Click on the required month and and enter the required month in 'MM' format (e.g. 01 or January, 12 for December) Click on the day and enter the required date in 'DD' format (enter 01-31 as required) Where membership scheme will be available to join until indefinitely, then this date needs to be set far into the future. In the above example this 'Scheme Valid Until' has been set to 31/12/2049. However, some customers will use this to restrict when specific membership types can be signed up from and to as required by their business. ‘Promotion:’ The ‘Promotion’ dropdown allows you to associate a single ‘Members’ type promotion to a ‘Membership Type’. Click on the ‘Promotion’ dropdown and select a promotion if required. This promotion must have been set up as a 'Members type promotion, otherwise it will not show in the dropdown list. Please note setting up ‘Promotions’ is outside the scope of this document and are covered in a separate guide. When a member card is swiped, scanned (depending on the equipment you have purchased from K3), or the member is found (using the ‘Find Member’ button) before the transaction is completed, the chosen ‘Promotion’ will fire automatically. All items in the basket that are eligible for discount, will have the discount automatically applied. Allow D/D: The 'Allow DD' settings are outside the scope of this manual, as 'Direct Debits' is a chargeable module in MStore that needs to be purchased. Please contact your Account Manager for details on this functionality. A direct debits user guide can be supplied to customers who have purchased this module. Restrict Entries To: This limits the number of times a membership can be used. This could be number of entries per day or year. If no restriction is required, the boxes can be left blank. Scheme Min Age and Max age This is for setting age limits on memberships. Most attractions have different prices for different age groups (e.g. children and concessions). Using the ‘Scheme Min Age’ and ‘Scheme Max Age’ boxes, the required age range can be assigned to a membership. If no age limit is required, enter -1 in the ‘Scheme Min Age’ and ‘Scheme Max Age’ boxes. Please note this can simply be achieved by deleting any data in these fields, as this will reset these to the default values (i.e. -1 in both fields) We will continue with our ‘Child Membership’ example and enter ‘0’ as the ‘Scheme Min Age’ and ‘18’ as the ‘Scheme Max Age’. Please not if you setting age criteria as a requirement on on any membership type, then the 'Date of Birth' should be set as a mandatory requirement for the relevant membership types. If over max age, suggest this scheme When adding a new member via the wizard, you select the ‘Membership Type’. If the age entered is over the ‘Max’ age for the selected type, then the system can suggest another type of membership. For example, if you selected a ‘Child Membership’ but then entered the member’s age as 19, the software would suggest the ‘Adult membership’. To set the suggested membership type to suggest, simply select the 'Code' of the relevant membership type. At this point click ‘Apply’ to save the ‘Membership Type’ data entered to this point. Membership Setup - PLU Requirements The next section of the ‘Membership/Privilege Schemes’ window is for linking the relevant PLU’s for the prices, fees or renewal discount that can be applied to a ‘Membership Type’. Only the ones key to setting up the MStore memberships to work in-house (not online) will be detailed. As mentioned previously although we do have a Direct Debits module, the set of of direct debit memberships is not covered in this guide. The below are the key PLUs. The relevant fees / prices / discount that apply to a membership type need to be selected. The key ones that we need to focus on are explained below: Entry Fee: This is the PLU for the price that members are charged each time they enter (this can be a £0.00 priced PLU). This is the PLU that would also be set up with the relevant ‘Footfall’, so that when the member is validated on entry, the footfall is recorded. Membership Price: This is the PLU for the price to buy the actual membership (e.g. the price of the annual membership / pass). Typically this would not be set up with any 'Footfall' as scanning / swiping the member card on re-entry will add footfall. Joining Fee: If required assign this PLU if there is a “one-off” joining fee. This will be charged on top of the ‘Membership Price’ (this may be used e.g. to cover any administration costs etc). Renewal Discount: If required, you can assign a PLU here with a price corresponding to the amount discount that will be given on renewal (e.g. set up ‘Renewal Discount PLU with a value of £5.00). No Discount after X renewals If the PLU for Renewal Discount is in place, then you also need to check these settings. If the renewal discount applies indefinitely then these settings can be left alone. Alternatively, If the renewal discount must only be applied for a specific number of renewals then these settings are used. Fist click the box 'No Discount after X renewals' so it is ticked, then in the field to the right enter the relevant number. We will continue with our example of setting up a Child annual membership. Normally we would have setup our PLU’s first via the ‘New PLU/Stock Wizard’. The next section covers how to add the relevant PLU’s, in case this has not been done already. If the required PLU's have already been created then just go straight to Section 6. If you need to create PLUs at this point please remember to click 'Apply' to save the changes made in the above screen. Then click 'Close' and follow the instructions in the sections below. Creation of the PLUs to Set-Up a Membership Type PLU’s for memberships can be setup in the ‘New PLU/Stock Wizard’. This can be found by doing the following: 1. Click on the ‘Setup’ icon. 2. Click ‘Pricing’. 3. Double click on ‘New PLU/Stock Wizard’. This will now load the ‘New stock/PLU Wizard’ and provide a choice of the PLU’s to create. The next section covers the set-up of the different PLU’s that may be required to set up a ‘Membership Type’ in the MStore. Creating the Entry Fee PLU The first PLU we need to create is for our membership ‘Entry Fee’. This is how much we charge members each time they come. It is also the PLU that adds ‘Footfall’ to our daily entry figures. This needs to be set up as an ‘Admission Ticket’ PLU. On the ‘New stock/PLU Wizard’ window, click on the dot next to ‘Admission Ticket’. Then click on the ‘Next’ button, and then ‘Price’ window is now displayed. In the ‘Price’ window, first enter the ‘Short Description’ as required. This is the description shown on the till receipts and shown on the till’s rear customer display, if your till has these. The number of characters that will fit on your receipt paper width will be determined by the font size on your receipt. Next enter the ‘Long Description’ as required. This is the description that is used on the reports in the MStore back office software, so this can be longer. Pricing Type: ‘Pricing Type’ has one of four options, which are explained below: Allow: The user can change the price (please note the ‘Security Group’ a user is in can allow/disallow this too ) Do not allow: The price cannot be changed by the user. Force price entry: The user must enter a price. Embedded price: The price of the item is within the barcode (rarely used). Admission prices are normally fixed price, especially in the case of memberships. So, in this example, click on the dot next to ‘Do not allow’. Sales Analysis Code: Select the required ‘Analysis Code’ that the sale of this PLU will belong to for reporting purposes. In our example, we will use the ‘Analysis Code’ of ‘Memberships’. This can be selected from the dropdown but it is recommended to click the 'Analysis Codes' button then drill down to (by clicking the + icons) then clicking on the required 'Analysis Code' so it is highlighted. Then click the 'Use Code' button on this screen. This way allows you to see and select the correct part of the hierarchical 'Analysis Code' structure the PLU needs to be allocated to, which may not be evident using the dropdown. The next section of is based around setting the price. Entry for members at most attractions is free, so we will set to ‘Sell Price (Inc Vat):’ to £0.00 However member entry could be at a reduced price, so set this price to suite your business needs. Select the required ‘VAT code:’ for this PLU (in this case as our example is £0 member entry the 'Exempt' rate was selected). For companies that have (i) an integration between MStore and a 3rd party finance system (ii) or use MStore to generate a report on sales by Nominal Codes, then the 'Nominal Codes' dropdowns can be used to select the 1st and 2nd 'Nominal Code' on a PLU. Please note setting up nominal codes for either reporting purposes or for a 3rd party integration is outside the scope of this manual. Please contact your Account Manager for more information if this is a requirement.. The final section on this window controls the dates the PLU price is valid from/to (Price valid from: and Price valid to:) By default, the start date is set to today and the end in ten years time. If a PLU price will remain the same then you can set this to a date much further into the future (e.g. 31/12/2099 as below). Please note if the PLU price changes at any time the PLU can be edited to put in a a new price and it's start and end dates. We’ve now filled in all the necessary data in this screen, so click on ‘Next’. The next window is the PLU type window. This is for the setting up of food items and admission tickets. Because we selected Admission ticket when first creating the PLU there is a tick in the 'This is an admission item' box. Because this is a free membership entry PLU, we are only interested in the Footfall related boxes. Our ‘Child Membership’ will admit one, so we will set the ‘Footfall’ to 1. Typically member entry may not require any other settings to be applied in this screen. (as no tickets are printed and member entry is not normally capacity managed by a 'Session') Now that we are finished with this window, we click on the ‘Next’ button. This will take us to the final window for setting up our 'Child Membership Entry' PLU. The final data we need to fill in is to create a Code/Barcode for this PLU. The code can be anything we want but ideally should follow a structure of you own that everyone adheres to. For our example we will use CHMEMENTRY and then click the ‘Add’ button. You can now see that the Code has been created so click the ‘Finish’ button. You are now told that all the information you’ve filled in has saved and the PLU has been created. Now click OK to close the window. We are not returned to the New Stock/PLU Wizard window. This is very useful as we now need to create our PLU for the cost of the membership, which is covered in the below section. Creating the Membership Fee PLU Membership PLUs basically are for any costs associated with memberships (cost of the membership, joining fees, etc). For the Child Membership we are setting up we must create the PLU for the cost of the membership. Click on the dot next to Membership item and then click on Next. The step are the same as setting up the 'Child Membership Entry' PLU. The key difference is as that this is the fee for signing up as a child membership there will be a price (e.g. £40) Also select the relevant VAT rate as required. Enter the start and end dates for the PLU price. If it is not known when this membership price will change, then enter a date way into the future in the 'Price Valid to:' If you know the price will go up on e.g. 01/012026, enter the last date the membership will be at this price e.g. 31/12/2025. Please note that in the wizard you can only set up the the first from/to price. Once the PLU has been set up it can then be edited to added to add all the future price changes required. If you do not offer gift aid on memberships, then simply click ‘Next’ in the below screen. However, if you can claim gift aid on membership fees then the typical mechanism for membership is where the membership price is the same with and without gift aid. In this scenario you need to click in the 'This is an admission item' box, so it becomes ticked. Then you simply need to click on the 'Gift Aid' box shown, so it becomes ticked. Likewise if you want to record footfall on selling the membership, then click in the 'This is an admission item' box, so it ticked. Typically 'Footfall' is not recorded when selling a membership but if required enter the 'Footfall' in the relevant field. Click ‘Next’ once all the data is entered. Finally, the ‘Codes/Finish’ screen must be completed. Fill it in as we did when creating our child membership admission PLU. Enter the required code in the ‘Code/Barcode’ field and click on ‘Add’ You will now seethe PLU showing (highlighted yellow) in the lower part of the screen. Next click ‘Finish’ This has now created our membership fee PLU. You will now see the following message, click ‘OK’. We have now created all the required PLUs for this specific. Next we need to finish off setting up our ‘Child Membership’ Membership Type. Creating a Membership Type Now that we have all the PLUs required, we must add them to the Membership type. Navigate back to the Membership created earlier (Setup > Customer > Membership Types) If you don’t see your new membership type straight away scroll down as it may be at the bottom of the list (as per our example below). The position of the membership type in this list is also the order it will appear on the till. By clicking on the arrow buttons shown, we can move membership types up or down the list. Now we can start linking all our PLUs to the membership type so that all the right prices are charged. The first PLU to setup is the ‘Entry Fee’, we do this by clicking on the arrow next to the box. You are now presented with the PLU search window. You may have come across this window in other screens in the MStore software and it works in the same way. We need to find the 'Child Membership Entry' PLU we setup earlier. Please note the ‘Category’ is already set to ‘Admission’ automatically as this is the PLU category that the PLU must be set up using. Enter the required 'Selection Criteria' (in this case we entered the start of the relevant PLU code made earlier). However you could have searched by the other fields available in the search criteria (e.g. 'Description or 'Analysis Code') Please note if you want to find e.g. all PLU's containing a specific word or code you can use the % wild card. For example, to search for all PLU descriptions containing child, enter %child in the 'Description' field. N.B. if you type child only in the description field the search will find only PLU descriptions starting in the word ch. Click 'Search' and the results will be displayed in the above screen. Click on the relevant PLU so it is highlighted. In the above search one item was found so it is highlighted automatically. Then click on ‘Use Selected PLU’. Please note if you double clicked the PLU it would load the ‘PLU Maintenance’ window. You can now see that the ‘Entry Fee’ box has been updated with the price (£0.00) of the free member admission fee. Repeat the same steps as detailed above to assign the required ‘Membership Price’ PLU. The price of the membership fee (in this case £40) should appear where shown. If you accidentally select the wrong PLU, click on the ‘X’ to the left of the box to clear the PLU, then re-assign the correct PLU as explained previously. This is the baseline set-up that is required for most memberships to enable members to allow a membership(s) to be sold, and then these members could enter for free with the correct footfall recorded. Click on ‘Apply’ to save the details. There are several other boxes and sections within the ‘Membership/Privilege Schemes’ window that are not mandatory but might be useful to us. These are explained below. 1. Inactive: These tick boxes control if the membership is active or not. If a membership is made inactive it cannot be sold, and its members can no longer use their cards. 2. Show Inactive: Clicking on this box causes all Inactive membership types to be shown in the list. These memberships types could now be viewed in this screen and edited again. 3. Allow Selling On Internet: This option is only applicable for customers who have purchased the MStore Online Memberships e-commerce pages. For customers who have purchased these pages, then this option needs to be ticked for all memberships types offered online. Online membership set up is outside the scope of this manual covered in a separate guide. If you want to enquire about having MStore Online Memberships e-commerce pages please contact your Account Manager.. 4. Count Total Footfall Per Transaction This option is to make the system count customer visits either per group (one visit per transaction regardless of number of people), or per each transaction line that involved customer entry as required. 5. Card Design This option only applies to customers who have purchased and had installed member card printers by K3. For those customers they would select the relevant member card design here. A member card design would be set up and tested and assigned here by K3 as part of the installation process. If you want to enquire about having member card printers, please contact your Account Manager. 6. Welcome Letter: This is where we can select ‘Welcome Letter’ Microsoft Word document template. Click on the box with the … button to select the required template (using ‘Windows Explorer’). To set these up you will need training on creating mail merge template documents, this is covered in a separate user guide. If a ‘Welcome Letter’ has been selected then on signing up a member using the 'New Member Wizard' you will be asked whether you want to print this letter during the sign up process. 7. Mandatory Items: This option can be used, if there is certain information we must collect when setting up a new Member. The ‘Mandatory Items’ tick boxes can be used to define the mandatory information requirements. Creating a New Member Creating new members is normally done via the ‘New Member Wizard’. This can be found in the MStore software by 1. clicking the ‘Members’ button, then 2. clicking the ‘Wizard’ button. The ‘New Member Wizard’ can also be found on the till. If this button doesn’t exist on your current till screen, one can be created where required. If you are unsure how to do this, ask a colleague who has been trained on how to do this, alternatively please refer to the ‘Configuring Till Buttons’ Manual. Please not this button could have been put anywhere by your colleagues and could have been re-named to whatever they like, so please check whether it already exists. For reference the button to trigger the \"New member Wizard\" needs to be configured as a 'Command' button. The command 'New Member Wizard' then needs to be selected and the button named accordingly. If you click the correctly configured button, it will launch the ‘New Member Wizard’ screen shown below. We will now setup a new member, selecting the ‘Child Membership’ type we setup earlier. The first screen is simple to use and captures some basic, essential data for the membership. Swipe Card This is the number on the membership card you are giving to the customer. If you have pre-printed, barcoded member cards, simply scan the barcode on this card. The card number will then be filled in for you automatically. If you do not have a scanner on the till, then enter the card number you are issuing. Please note for customers that have member card printers then the car number is automatically created. For those customers the swipe card box will show the text 'Auto' and they start at the post code entry. Post Code The Post Code of the member House Name/No First line of the members address Surname Surname of the new member Once all the required data has been entered, click ‘Next’. The second page of the membership wizard will now appear. You will notice that some of the details are already filled in automatically. Please note any fields marked with * are a mandatory field in these screens. The fields are explained below: Swipe card: This is copied across from the previous screen (or will show 'Auto' if set to be automatic). Title: This can be selected from the dropdown, or click in the field and enter a new title. First name: Enter the first name of the new member. Surname: This is copied across from the previous screen. Memb Type: Using the dropdown, select the membership type required. Start date: This is the date the membership begins (defaults to start today). Expires: The expiry date is automatically calculated (based on the duration set in that membership type) Gender: Click in the circle next to the gender required. Date of birth: If we are not worried about exact ages, click the 'Over 18' tick box. If date of birth is required or has been set to mandatory, it is quickest to: Click on the year and type in the year in YYYY format (e.g. enter 2020) Then click in the month and enter the month in MM format (e.g. 01 for January or 12 for December) Finally, click in the day and enter the day in DD format (e.g. 01 to 31) Prime contact: If we are entering multiple members, we can select one to be the “Prime Contact”. N.B. the first person added will default to be the prime contact, so typically add the contact person first. Photograph: If required we can capture a photograph of the member. Click 'Preview' to start the camera and 'Capture' to take the picture. Please note you must have purchased and had web cameras installed by K3 on the tills to support this. If you require web cameras, please contact your Account Manager Once you’ve filled in all the boxes, click on the ‘Next’ button. You will notice that a new line appears with the member details at the bottom of the screen. Card, Title and First name boxes are cleared, ready to be filled in again. This is so multiple members of the same family can be added in a single transaction. We are only entering one membership in this example, so click the ‘Next’ button. ‘Account Billing Address’ is the next page of the wizard, and again some data is already populated for you. Please check the data that is pre-populated, all the fields are explained below: Account Name: Populated for you with the member surname Email: Enter if required Address: You can enter the additional address data by clicking directly in the 'Address' field and type in the data. Alternatively, click the 'Address' button to bring up a form and enter the data in there and click 'Ok'. If you have purchased post code look up in here you enter the postcode and click 'Search'. Then select the address from the list of results returned for this address. and select the integration Town: Enter as required County: Enter as required Postcode: Enter as required Telephone: Enter as required Source: Select as required (N.B. the list of options are user definable in Setup > System > Lookup Items) Addressee: Enter as required. Generally used for customers using mail merges to Microsoft (MS) Word only. Dear: \"Dear\" name. Enter as required (generally used for customers using mail merges to MS Word only) Account flags: Tick multiple if required. These can be used to filter data in MStore. Generally used for extracting data to Excel for creating mail merges into MS Word from MStore. (N.B. the list of options are user definable in Setup > System > Lookup Items) This is a Gift or Member at a different Address: This is ticked where the memberships are being purchased for someone else. If ticked then another screen will appear next to enter the details for the person who is receiving the gift. Click 'Next' once all the data has been entered in the above screen The GDPR options screen will now be displayed. Ask the customer the necessary questions to get their GDPR preferences. To opt out of contact click 'Do not make any contact'. Alternatively select one or more options in each of the 3 sections of this form (under the blue section headings) To select all the options in a section, then click the relevant 'Select All' box for that section (located on the right hand side) Please note some customers may have decided not to take on the GDPR module. If so the previous screen will simply have an 'Ok to Mail' and 'Ok to Email' tick box. The ‘GDPR Module’ is outside the scope of this manual, and this is a chargeable module. If you are interested in purchasing, or receiving training on the ‘GDPR Module’, please contact your Account Manager. Once the GDPR options have been selected, click 'Next'. The ‘Payment Details’ Window The top section of the screen gives a list of new members and summary of details. The bottom section shows the finance side, with any deductions and the total money to pay. Note: ‘Less refund Amt’ (‘Find TXN’ button) is to enable you to deduct admission tickets already purchased from the cost of a membership. By clicking on the ‘Find TXN’ button you can find a specific transaction and select the admission ticket(s) that you want to deduct from the value from the membership price. Alternatively you can just check their receipt by eye and type in the value to deduct from the price of the membership in the 'Less Refund Amt' field. If you offer gift aid and the customer is eligible to gift aid the membership, then tick the 'Gift Aid?' box. Please note this will require the PLU to have been set up correctly to allow gift aid for this to work. If retrospectively doing member sign ups at the till, you can use the calendar drop down to change the gift aid claim date. If a 'Welcome Letter' was assigned to the membership type then the 'Print Welcome Letter?' option will default to ticked. If left ticked on finishing the transaction, you will prompted as to which printer to print the letter on. If you do not want to print a 'Welcome Letter' then click the tick icon and it will toggle off (it turns to an X symbol) Check the summary given and all the details are correct in the above screen, then click the ‘Finish’ button. Now go ahead and pay for this like any other till transaction (e.g. press Sub Total, then Cash, etc). N.B. other items can be added to the transaction before you finish the transaction (if required). Then complete the transaction in the normal way by clicking 'Subtotal' and selecting the required payment method. The member has been added in MStore. If you have purchased and have set up member card printing, you will receive prompts to print on finishing the transaction. Likewise if you have set up and ticked the 'Welcome Letter' option, you will receive prompts to print the letter at this point. Please note, if you ticked the 'Gift Aid' option in the last screen of the 'Membership Wizard', then gift aid mode will be on. This can be seen by the (red) 'Gift Aid' icon shown on the bottom left of the till screen. With Gift Aid mode 'on' then on pressing any method of payment, then an additional screen will appear as below. This is the gift aid entry form and you would need to ensure the details of the person paying for the membership are entered here, and that they are eligible for gift aid. Please check / amend the details. Click 'Ok' once the details are correct. You would then finish the transaction as usual to payment method selected and the member has been added. Alternatively, if at this point the customer opts out of gift aid or is ineligible , then click 'Cancel'. Then on the till you would need to turn 'Gift Aid' off by pressing the relevant button (like the one below) Please note as you design the tills screens, this could have been put anywhere on your till and could a different name/colour For reference below are the brief details of the button setup required for the button that turns gift aid on/off manually. A colleague that knows how to add buttons to till screens shoudl be able to set this up for you, if not already present. Make the button name, colours, size and location to be as required on each till screen layout it is needed on. Make sure you send updates to all tills to ensure they have this button (via Edit > Recreate Till Data) Finding a member on the Till If a member has forgotten their ID card, they can be found manually. This can be done by adding a ‘Find Member’ button to the till (Button Action > Command > Find member). Please first ask your colleagues if they know where this button is, as it could have been put anywhere on your till screens. Likewise it could have been called anything but for our example it is the default name 'Find member'. As you can from our till screen below this button could also be put in multiple places as required. Click the ‘Find Member’ button and we are taken to a search screen. Enter a name in the format Surname,Forename in the Name field (e.g. Smith,John)and click ‘Search’. To be quicker you could enter just Smith or Smith,J but this will potentially return a lot of results. In the above screen you will see multiple records for John Smith were returned (the red lines are expired members) You would need to check the member address to ascertain whether the membership has expired. In this scenario it is the the white line (non expired member) with card number MEM54321 (that was created previously) Click on the specific member record you want to admit (it becomes highlighted blue) and click the 'OK' button. You will now see the members details on the till, in exactly the same way as if the operator had scanned their membership card. Please note if a member photo had been captured, this would also show in the bottom left of this screen. The 'Visits' figure will update after the transaction for this first member entry is completed. Please note the 'Visits' figure is per calendar year, so every calendar year this value resets will start from zero again. To process member entry you need to just click 'Subtotal', then select 'Cash'. However the member may want to buy additional items, which can show in the member transaction history. To do this find the member as above, sell the other items so they also show in the basket, then finish the transaction. This applies whether here a member card has been swiped, scanned, or found by the above method. Updating a Member's Details For a variety of reason member details might need to be changed (due to marriage, change of address, etc). Member details can be found and updated in the ‘Members’ screen. In this screen all the boxes highlighted (individually or a combination of them) can be used to search for a member record. Searching for the member’s name in ‘Name/Number’ field is often the best way to search for a member, if they do not know their card number. If you wanted to search for any record containing the name ‘Smith’, type in ‘%Smith’ in the ‘Name/Number’ field and click ‘Search’. However, as above it is better to narrow down the search to limit results, so typing Smith,John in the 'Name/Number' field shoudl find the data quickly. Sometimes adding in a 'Member Type' in the search is useful, this can be done using the dropdown. If a member does not show please note by default the search excludes expired members, to include them click the 'Include Expired Members' box. As this may be why you cannot find a specific member. The search results are listed below the search criteria. To load the required record, double click on it. Any of the details displayed can be updated. Simply amend the required details and then click the ‘OK’ button. The member data has now changed. Note: the ‘OK’ button will remain greyed out until a change is made to the member. Footnote: If you do not have some of the functionality show in the screenshots in this user guide, then your software version may need to be upgraded to add the missing functionality. Please contact your Account Manager who can discuss this.",

    "title": "PLU Upgrades",
    "text": "TABLE OF CONTENTS Introduction PLU Upgrades Screen PLU Upgrades 'Details' Screen PLU Upgrade Conditions PLU Upgrade Rules in The Membership Wizard Upgrade Rule - Renewal Discount PLU Upgrades on Online Membership Pages Introduction This manual explains how to set up ‘PLU Upgrades’. These are exclusively for use with the ‘Memberships’ module and are rules that can be set up to enable specified combinations of memberships to automatically sell at a reduced price. This is most often used when purchasing specific combinations of e.g. adult and child memberships that qualify for a discounted price. For example, buying 2 x adult memberships (£50 each) and 2 x child memberships at (£25 each) would normally cost £150, however you want to offer this combination at a discounted price of e.g. £125. This can be achieved by setting up an upgrade rule. The process of setting up and demonstrating how ‘PLU Upgrades’ work when signing up members is covered in this manual. PLU Upgrades Screen To open the ‘PLU Upgrades’ screen: 1. Click the ‘Setup’ icon. then 2. Click the ‘Pricing’ icon. Then 3. double click the ‘PLU Upgrades’ icon. To add a new upgrade rule, click on the ‘New Item’ icon. If there were no upgrade rules set up then the cursor will now go to the 'Description' field in the ‘Details’ section of the screen. If there were already rules present in the above screen, clicking the new button will create a new blank form, and again the cursor will go to the 'Description' field in the ‘Details’ section of the screen. The content of the 'Details' screen is detailed in the next section. PLU Upgrades 'Details' Screen This guide will use the example of setting up a rule where buying 2 x Adult memberships (£50 each) and 2 x Child memberships at (£25 each) that should be £150 but will be offered at a discounted price of e.g. £125 Description: Enter a brief description for this rule (e.g. Family Upgrade). Sell / Discount: Unless instructed otherwise by K3 then only ‘Sell PLU’ should be selected here. Min Qualifying Quantity / Max Qualifying Quantity: Enter how many (qualifying membership) PLU’s must be sold to activate the upgrade rule. In our example you must buy 2 x Adult and 2 x Child memberships to qualify, so for this specific scenario the number 4 would be entered in both boxes. Sell Code: This is the PLU that you will sell instead i.e. the ‘Family Membership’ PLU. To add the PLU click the button, then use the ‘Price Index’ screen to find and select the correct PLU. In this case part of the PLU code was entered, then click 'Search'. Click on the PLU to select t (unless one PLU only is found) then click the 'Use Selected PLU' button to select it. N.B. if the PLU has not already been created , then on the ‘Prices Index’ screen click the ‘New’ button and create a new PLU at the required price as usual. In this example a PLU was created for the total discounted price that the 2 Adult and 2 Child memberships will be offered at e.g.£125. If gift aid can be offered on the discounted price set the gift aid options and price up in the PLU as usual. The PLU used for this example is shown below for reference, but needs to be set up as required. Once you have selected the PLU fro the price of the upgrade rule, it will show here. Click the 'Apply' button to accept the change for this part of the setup. Now the basic ‘Details’ of the upgrade rule have been created. The upgrade rule details will be showing at the top of the screen. Next the qualifying membership PLU(s) need to be added to this rule. These are known as the ‘PLU Upgrade Conditions’ and are explained in the following section. PLU Upgrade Conditions To define the ‘PLU Upgrade Conditions’, double click on the relevant rule description. The ‘PLU Upgrade Conditions’ screen will now be showing. Next click the button and select the first qualifying membership PLU from the ‘Price Index’ screen. For this scenario the 'Adult Membership' PLU with code K3MEM1 was found in the search, then clicked on, then the 'Use Selected PLU' button was clicked. This PLU must be exactly the same PLU code as the ‘Membership Price’ PLU used in the corresponding ‘Membership Type’. N.B. as stated previously, ‘Membership Types’ must be set-up before using this manual. 1. The name of the first PLU selected will now show here. 2. Next set the ‘Min Required Qty’ and ‘Max Allowed Qty’ for this membership PLU as required. For this rule we are trying to set up is for 2x Adult + 2x Child Memberships for a discounted price, then in this example the number 2 needs to be entered in both boxes. 3. Click 'Apply' once the conditions for the first membership have been entered. This PLU will now show in the list of ‘PLU Upgrade Conditions’. To add the next condition, click the ‘New Item’ icon. In this specific example you would repeat the process but this time selecting the PLU for the 'Child Membership' (PLU code K3MEM2), again setting both the ‘Min Required Qty’ and ‘Max Allowed Qty’ to be 2. Click the ‘Apply’ button to accept this second condition. The second of ‘PLU Upgrade Conditions’ has now been added and will appear at the top of the screen. Once all the ‘PLU Upgrade Conditions’ have been added, click the ‘Close’ button. A PLU upgrade rule has now been added. For now click the ‘Close’ button again, to exit the ‘PLU Upgrades’ screen. Ensure you ‘Recreate Till Data’, so any new PLU’s you created are sent to the tills. Now you must test all the ‘PLU Upgrade Rules’, this process is covered in the next section. PLU Upgrade Rules in The Membership Wizard Please note the PLU upgrades will trigger both at the till and online in our online memberships pages. You will need to ensure the rule is set up as detailed above but for the online membership PLU codes. It is possible that you use different PLU codes for in house and online memberships. However first we will first cover off how to test a membership will trigger when usign the Membership Wizard to add members either in the MStore back office software or at the till (PoS). Testing the Wizard in the back office software is recommended as this allows you to add and delete a member without making a transaction. The member can also be deleted immediately,. To access the MStore back office ‘Membership Wizard’: 1. Click the ‘Members’ main menu icon. 2. Next click the ‘Wizard’ icon. The ‘Membership Wizard’ screen will then pop up as shown below. Enter a made up card number and test details (or your own to remember and find them later) Input test data into the first test ‘Adult Membership’ record as required and click 'Next'. Make sure you select the 'Adult membership' with the same PLU code as the one used in the upgrade rule conditions. Input test data into the second test ‘Adult Membership’ record as required and click 'Next'. Again ensure you select the 'Adult membership' with the same PLU code as the one used in the upgrade rule conditions. Input test data into the first test ‘Child Membership’ record as required and click 'Next'. Make sure you select the 'Child membership' with the same PLU code as the one used in the upgrade rule conditions. Input test data into the second test ‘Child Membership’ record as required and click 'Next'. Again ensure you select the 'Child membership' with the same PLU code as the one used in the upgrade rule conditions. Once you have added a combination of memberships that should trigger the rule. (i.e. 2 x Adult and 2 x Child memberships), Click the ‘Next’ button. Enter test / dummy account details as required and click the ‘Next’ button. Next enter GDPR preferences as required and click 'Next'. (for customers without the GDPR module click the relevant mailing tick box preferences in the previous screen) Once the options have been selected click the ‘Next’ button If you have set up the PLU upgrade correctly, you should see the individual memberships listed but at £0 price. There will be a lien at the bottom showing the Upgrade PLU description and price, in this case £125. If you see this then the rule is working as it has triggered the upgrade PLU price. At this point you would click the ‘Cancel’ button to avoid adding the test / dummy data. If you have created multiple PLU upgrade rules, then use the same process in the ‘Membership Wizard’ to check that all the upgrade rules work correctly. You now know how to add and test ‘PLU Upgrades’, that can be used to apply a reduced price on purchasing specified combinations of memberships. Upgrade Rule - Renewal Discount Please note there is an additional field on the upgrade rules 'Details' screen to enable rule discount to be applied. To do this first you must set up a PLU for the value of this discount. in this case we will say renewing this same combination gets £10 discount, so a PLU is first set up for this value. This will be the PLU this discount reports against. Set it up as a 'Membership Item' category PLU. To apply this PLU click the arrow shown. Search for and select the PLU as detailed previously. The PLU description will appear where shown. Click 'Apply'. In this example we will demonstrate with the same memberships but their membership dates set to be expired. On finding or scanning a member card then all members will show as expired (as their joining date had to be the same) For the upgrade rule renewal discount to trigger all members must be renewed in the usual way. (i.e. the 'Renew' button was clicked for each member record) Once each member has been renewed click 'Next' Check / amend the account details and click 'Next' Check / amend the GDPR options and click 'Next' On renewal only the total has now reduced by the £10 from the upgrade rule price of £125. The price to pay now shows at the discounted price of £115 due to the deduction of the renewal discount value. PLU Upgrades on Online Membership Pages For those customers that have purchased K3 online membership e-commerce pages then if the same PLU's as above are set up to sell as online memberships, then the same mechanism will work online. Sell a combination that triggers the upgrade rule. Next enter the test data for the 4 memberships in the usual way (this part of the process is not show here). In the basket the upgrade rule will trigger in the same way if set up correctly. Again at this point the basket contents can be deleted as the test has shown the rule triggers. However, if you want to do an end to end test you can indeed pay for the memberships and check the transaction goes through, then check the memberships in MStore and refund yourself (outside MStore via the online payment provider's refund portal) then candle the memberships in MStore.",

    "text": "TABLE OF CONTENTS Introduction 'Customer' Mail Merge Template Creation Now scroll down to the Section 4 titled 'Adding Merge Fields to a Template'. 'Member' Mail Merge Template Creation 'Booking' Mail Merge Template Creation Now follow the instructions in Section 4 below. Adding Merge Fields To a Template Previewing Your Mail Merge Template Introduction This guide explains how to input merge fields onto a pre-existing Microsoft Word (MS) documents, in order to create Customer, Member or Booking “mail merge template” that are as required for mail merges which can be started from within MStore. Please note K3 not install or supply the MS Word software this needs to have already been installed on your computer. In addition K3 do not support or provide training on using MS Word itself, including using MS Word to carry out mail merges. There are specific ways to create a mail merge template for main the 3 different mail merge purposes, namely a \"Customer\", \"Member\" or \"Booking\" mail merge. The process to create each mail merge template type is similar but differs slightly and are explained below. 'Customer' Mail Merge Template Creation First, navigate to the Customers screen as follows: 1. Click the ‘Setup’ icon. 2. Click the ‘Customer’ icon. 3. Double click the ‘Customers’ icon. Once in the Customers screen you simply need to search for any customer record and click the ‘Search’ button. Double click or highlight the record you wish to use and click the ‘OK’ button. Once the customer record opens, click ‘Edit’, which opens a dropdown menu. Click the ‘Edit Mailmerge Template’ option from the dropdown menu. This will open up MS Windows 'File Explorer', simply find and select the require MS Word document and click ‘Open’. Now scroll down to the Section 4 titled 'Adding Merge Fields to a Template'. 'Member' Mail Merge Template Creation Click the ‘Members’ icon. Find any member using member search screen. Double-click on the member record to open it. On the member record click ‘Edit’, which opens a dropdown menu. Click the ‘Edit Mailmerge Template’ option from the dropdown menu. This will open up MS Windows 'File Explorer', simply find and select the require MS Word document and click ‘Open’. Now scroll down to the Section 4 titled 'Adding Merge Fields to a Template'. 'Booking' Mail Merge Template Creation Click the ‘Diary’ icon. Now click the ‘Find BK’ (find booking) icon. Use the ‘Booking Search’ screen to find any booking. Double click any booking, this will open the selected Booking record. At the top of the booking record screen, click ‘Edit’, which opens a dropdown menu. Click the ‘Edit Mailmerge Template’ option from the dropdown menu. This will open up MS Windows 'File Explorer', simply find and select the require MS Word document and click ‘Open’. Now follow the instructions in Section 4 below. Adding Merge Fields To a Template Once the MS Word document has been opened, the process for adding merge fields is the same across the 3 different categories of mail merge types as detailed in the previous sections (namely Member, Customer and Booking mail merges). The only variations are the merge fields available differ for each different type of mail merge category mentioned above. Please Note: for some versions of Microsoft Word, you may have to minimise, then maximise the MS Word document first again in order to be able to insert a merge field into it. It is possible to insert merge fields anywhere on the document, or even into a blank document. The method shown is using a Word document in which the fixed-text content has already been created. This is recommended, as having the fixed-text content of the letter in place where the merge fields need to be added makes is simpler to add the required merge fields names in the correct positions. In this example, all the information we want to be replaced by merge fields are highlighted in yellow, the highlighting would simply be removed once all the required merge fields have been added. First, ensure you have the ‘Mailings’ tab selected. Select where you want to insert the merge field using your mouse in the usual way. In the above example the word Title (using click and drag), which will be replaced by the relevant merge filed. Click on the ‘Insert Merge Field’ icon. This will then produce a dropdown menu of the merge fields available for your chosen template category. Click on the name of the merge field that is required, in this example the 'Title' merge field is selected. When you have successfully added a merge field, it will appear inside > these brackets For example in the below you will see the > and > merge fields were added Repeat the previous steps until all the required merge fields have been added into the MS Word document. Previewing Your Mail Merge Template When you have added all the necessary merge fields, the document will look like the one below. Now it is advised you check all the merge fields you have inputted display the required information. To do this, click on ‘Preview Results’ (on the ‘Mailings’ tab). This will then show the information merged from the the previously selected Booking / Customer / Member record (depending on the record that you opened) You can use the mail merge functionality within MS Word to complete the mail merge as required and save the results. Please note any support with or training on MSWord for document creation or for carrying out mail merges is not covered by K3, as we do not provide training or support on Microsoft Word itself. K3 only provide training on how find /add the MStore specific merge fields into an MS Word document (as detailed above). Any support / training on using MS Word and it's mail merge functionality would need to be provided by your preferred training / support provider.",

The contents of this manual details what you need to do in order to set up the ‘Direct Debits’ system in the MStore back office software to work in-house only. The set up to sell direct debits online is out of the scope of this manual. The manual covers from start to finish what needs to be done in the software to set up the directs debits system, so you can in one process both sign up direct debit members at an MStore PoS (till) and take any payment using our ‘New Member Wizard’ on a till. There is also the ability just to take payment at the till only then someone can later add the member and set up their direct debit payments using the MStore back office software. The MStore software will also create industry standard direct debit submission files (“batches” in MStore) that can be submitted to your bank, but using the 3rd party system your bank provide to submit these direct debit files. Please note this is not an integration to your banks direct debit system. As MStore only creates these submission files, how to submit these to your bank and to use the software / online portal to do this is not covered by or supported by K3. Training or support on this process will need to be provided by your bank or their support / training service providers. As this is not a direct integration to your bank’s direct debt system, then please note the results of direct debt submission that come back from your bank are not directly processed into MStore. There are processes in the MStore back office software that need to be carried out, to mark which record in the MStore batch submission to the bank were successfully processed or not. The relevant MStore back office process are covered off in this manual and during training K3 can provide on the direct debits system. Online Direct Debits: The “in-house” module for till and back office direct debit sign up and maintenance (including submission file creation and direct debit membership renewal processes) is covered in this manual. However if you require to sell direct debits online via the K3 e-commerce pages then the required web pages and additional training to set these web pages up in the MStore software will need to be ordered. For more information on either purchasing the in house and or online Direct Debits module and the relevant training, then please contact your Customer Success Account Manager for a quote. Disclaimer: Please note that this manual requires the user to have prior knowledge and training on the MStore back office software. Where elements of the software are not explained, this is because these features need to be set up by an experienced user of the MStore software prior to using this manual. Please note although this manual explains the concepts of setting up direct debits, it is not designed to replace the need for training and consultancy. There are various ways and means of setting up direct debit memberships to sell both in-house and online, and all these scenarios cannot be covered off under one “generic” manual. If after receiving the necessary training you are still unsure how best to set up the direct debits system, then please contact your account manager to order the required training / consultancy. Create a PLU for the Initial Direct Debit Fee(s). Please note the software requires you to set up a PLU for the ‘Initial Direct Debit Fee’, whether you charge this fee or not. This is often used where your organisation wants to take an amount “up front” that will not be taken by direct debit. This is often done in order to safeguard against customers who may e.g. use their membership card to access your attraction but then cancel their direct debit before their first direct debt payment is taken. This “up front” or ‘Initial Direct Debit Fee’ can be whatever you like and a different amount can be taken up front for each membership type as required. You just have to set up as many different PLUs that you require for the various “up front” fess you wish to take. Alternatively, if you do not wish to take any ‘Initial Direct Debit Fee’ then you do need to set up a single PLU with a £0.00 value, as there needs to be an ‘Initial Direct Debit Fee’ a PLU assigned to each direct debit ‘Membership Type’ in MStore (covered in the next section of this guide). When setting up this PLU you must ensure that you: Set the ‘Category’ set to ‘Membership’. Set the ‘Override Price’ to ‘No Price Override’. Enter the price for administration fee as required, either the required price or £0.00 if no fee is charged. Once all the information has been entered as required, click on ‘Save’ then ‘Close’. Please note If there is no administration fee charged, you must still create this PLU If there are multiple different “up front” DD fees, then create as many PLUs as required. This could be just one PLU for each different up-front fee value offered. However, if the same “up front” fee is applied (e.g. £10) for different membership types and you want to get the breakdown of the quantity and value in reports separately for the Adult and Child “up front” fee, then multiple PLU’s need to be set up to get the required granularity of reporting. Please ensure send updates to your tills in the usual way (Edit > Recreate Till Data) to ensure they have these PLUs Create a PLU for the Direct Debit Discount(s). When picking the option to pay by direct debit MStore can automatically apply a discount for those selecting to pay by direct debit . If a percentage discount is not offered to members who pay by direct debit, proceed to the next section of this guide. If a percentage discount is offered to members who pay by direct debit, create a PLU for this. When setting up this PLU you must ensure that you: Set the ‘Category’ set to ‘Membership’. Set the ‘Override Price’ to ‘No Price Override’. The price of this PLU must be set at £0.00. The percentage discount will be calculated and assigned to this PLU in the relevant reports. Once all the information has been entered as required, click on ‘Save’ then ‘Close’. As one direct debit discount PLU can be assigned to each ‘Direct Debit Scheme’ then if required you can report the direct debit discount given to a separate PLU for each ‘Direct Debit Scheme’. However, if all the discount needs to just be reported to one PLU only then only one PLU may need to be created. Set up the required number of PLUs as required fore reporting of direct debit discounts given. Once the required PLU(s) have been created, ensure that you send the changes to the till(s) (by Edit > Recreate Till Data) Creating ‘Direct Debit Schemes’ First you must access the relevant ‘Direct Debit Schemes’ set up screen. To do this: Click on 1. ‘Setup’, then 2. click on ‘Customer’ then 3. double click on ‘Direct Debit Schemes’. Setting up an ‘Annual Direct Debit Scheme’ If no direct debit schemes have been set up previously, then you will see the following screen. Click on the ‘New’ button (in the top left corner of the screen) to start setting up your first direct debit scheme. Click in the ‘Scheme Name’ box and enter an appropriate description. Enter the required description, e.g. “Annual Direct Debit Scheme”. Now the ‘Collection Days’ must be entered. This is the day(s) of the month on which the collection of the direct annual debit is to be made. In this case, we want to make collections of any due annual direct debits on the 1st day of each month. To do this, click in the first ‘Collection Days’ box and type in the number 1. Please note there are four ‘Collection Days’ boxes but most businesses decide to only have one collection date. This is because usually you are charged by your bank for each collection attempt made. Taking into consideration you can enter a second, third and fourth collection day as required, to allow for an additional attempt to collect a direct debit to be made, if for any reason the first attempt failed. For example you may also have alternative collection dates for the 7th and the 14th day of the month. If so then you would enter 7 in the second and 14 in the third ‘Collection Days’ boxes as shown below In ‘Min Days before 1st Collection’ this is essentially the minimum number of calendar days it takes in total to process and confirm whether or not a new direct debit customer’s details are correct. For example, this would include the total number of days it takes for you to (i) get the necessary documentation completed and returned to you by the customer (i.e. the return of your completed direct debit mandate forms), (ii) carry out the required submission file related processes in MStore and (iii) the time for the bank to process and confirm whether or not the member’s bank account information you submitted to them was correct. Please note that K3 cannot advise you as to how long it takes your bank to carry out its part of the process, so you will need to contact your bank to confirm their processing time. Please be aware that your bank may quote their processing time days in working days rather than calendar days, so please clarify this with your bank. Let’s say that the total processing time is 10 days, i.e. the ‘Min Days before 1st Collection’ is 10 days. This means that if a new direct debit member joined today, you could only take the first payment from this customer 10 calendar days from today’s date. Simply click in the ‘Min Days before 1st Collection’ box and type in the required number. If you want to apply a discount for anyone signing up a specific direct debit scheme, then this is what the ‘Direct Debit Discount’ options are used for. This can be useful if you want to encourage paying by direct debit or perhaps to incentivise using a specific direct debit payment scheme, such as paying by direct debit as a one-off annual payment. If a percentage discount will be given for members paying by direct debit, enter the required percentage discount that will need to be in ‘Direct Debit Discount’ box For example, enter 10 in the box to apply a 10 % discount to members paying by direct debit. For reporting purposes any discount applied will be reported to a user defined PLU. To select the required PLU, click on the arrow icon to the right of the text ‘Use PLU’. The ‘Prices Index’ screen will now appear, so you can search for the required PLU. Enter the required search criteria to find the relevant PLU created previously and click the ‘Search’ button. If more than one search result appears, first click on the required PLU so that it is highlighted yellow. If only one result appears in the above screen it will automatically be highlighted yellow. Now click on the ‘Use Selected PLU’ button. The description of the PLU selected will now be showing in the field to the right of the text ‘Use PLU:’ If the incorrect PLU description is showing, repeat the relevant steps to select the correct PLU. You will notice that once you enter a whole number in the ‘Direct Debit Discount’ box, then two tick options. These tick box options are ‘Apply Discount in 1st Year’ and ‘Apply Discount in Subsequent Years’ now become active and the options are explained below: Apply Discount in 1st Year: tick this if the defined % discount will apply in the first year. Apply Discount in Subsequent Years: tick this if the defined % discount will apply in all subsequent years Select the discount options as required by clicking the required boxes, so they are ticked. If there is an administration fee for using a direct debit scheme, click in the box to the right of the text ‘Admin fee for using this scheme?’, so the box now has a tick in it. Click the arrow button To the right of the tick box to find and select the required PLU that was set up previously. As mentioned previously if more than one search result appears, first click on the required PLU so that it is highlighted yellow. If only one result appears in the above screen it will automatically be highlighted yellow. Now click on the ‘Use Selected PLU’ button at the bottom of the screen.. You will now notice that the price from the PLU you just selected is seen where indicated below. If the incorrect PLU price is showing, repeat the relevant steps to select the correct PLU. Click on the ‘Save’ button at the bottom of the screen to complete and save this new direct debit scheme. Once a direct debit scheme has been saved, 1.the summary information for the scheme appears at the top of the screen. If you want to edit a direct debit scheme you have created, simply click on the relevant scheme at the top of the screen. 2. Edit the selected schemes ‘Details’ in the bottom half of the screen as required. 3. Click 'Save' once all the details have been amended as required. Please note however you should not re-use existing direct debit schemes by simply renaming or changing the parameters of that scheme unless that direct debit scheme has never been used. Once a direct debit scheme has memberships that are using that direct debit scheme, it should not be amended as can cause data and audit trail issues. Setting up a ‘Monthly Direct Debit Scheme’ You can set up all the relevant direct debit schemes you require for your business needs. In this document we cover off setting up an annual and a monthly direct debit scheme only. You will need to set up all the options that you offer by direct debit. To add another direct debit scheme for monthly direct debits, click on the ‘New’ button. Enter an appropriate ‘Scheme Name’, e.g. “Monthly Direct Debit Scheme”. In this example select the frequency as ‘Monthly’. As payments are to be taken monthly, there are twelve payments to be taken in one year. The ‘Number of Payments’ entry is for one year, so type 12 in this box. Select the day of the month that monthly direct debits are being collected in the ‘Collection Days’ box. For example, monthly direct debits are to be collected on the 1st day of each month. To do this click in the first collection day's box and type in the number 1. Enter the ‘Min Days before 1st Collection’ as required (see previous example for explanation). In this case, we want this to again be set to seven working days, so click in the box and type in 7. If required enter the number corresponding to the percentage discount required in ‘Direct Debit Discount’ box and select the PLU this discount will be reported to. In this scenario, those that select the monthly direct debit scheme will not receive any discount, so none of the options were selected. If required specify the ‘Admin fee for using this scheme?’ (as explained in the previous example). In this scenario the admin fee will use the same PLU as the same (£10) admin fee applies. If each direct debit scheme requires a different admin fee, create the PLU’s required (covered earlier in this guide). Click the ‘Save’ button to accept any changes. You will now notice that two direct debit schemes have been created and saved. The summary information for each scheme is shown here. For reasons given previously it would only be recommended to amend details of any direct debit scheme before the first members has signed up using this direct debit scheme. To correct any set up issue at this point, first click on the required scheme so it becomes highlighted yellow. Once highlighted the ‘Details’ for this scheme can be viewed in the bottom half of the screen. If you need to make any changes to this scheme amend the information, then click the ‘Save’ button. Setting Up Membership Types Please Note: It is necessary to have training and consultation from K3 to determine your specific requirements and to set up the membership types accordingly. The direct debits module and online pages are chargeable add-ons to MStore, plus the training and consultation on setting up / operating the direct debits functionality is also chargeable. In this guide, direct debt memberships will be set up as separate, new membership types to any non-direct debit membership sold. This is often preferred by customers as you this allows them to get analysis of both sales and members records for both the direct debit and not direct debit membership types. However, if you need either a quote for the direct debit module charges or further training / consultation of you already have the direct debits system, then please contact your Customer Success Account Manager. The required ‘Membership Types’ need to be set up, to start this process then you need to: 1. Click on 'Setup' then 2. Next click on 'Customer' then 3. double click on 'Membership Types' Click on the ‘New’ button to start adding a new direct debit membership type. You now need to start entering the required data into the bottom half of the screen (below ‘Scheme Details’) Please Note: Not all the data in the membership ‘Scheme Details’ are covered off in this manual as they are already covered in detail in the ‘Memberships’ guide. The majority of the set-up is exactly the same as setting up a non-direct debit membership, so please refer to the MStore ‘Memberships’ guide if you require any the full descriptions on the fields that are common to both direct debit and non-direct membership types. For reference the field name of these common fields are highlighted grey in the below descriptions. The additional fields that are unique to setting up direct debits are highlighted in green in the below descriptions. As these are new concepts that apply only to direct debits, these are explained in detail in this manual (i) Enter an appropriate ‘Code’ for the membership scheme as required: max 10 characters – e.g. K3ADAD). (ii) Enter an appropriate ‘Description’ for the membership scheme: max 30 characters – e.g. Adult Direct Debit). (iii) Enter the required ‘Duration’ of this membership scheme (e.g. the £50 membership fee is for 1 year) Enter the relevant number in box to the right of ‘Duration’ (e.g. enter 1 in this box) Then click the drop-down arrow and click the required frequency from the below options (e.g. select year(s)) In the above scenario, once a member joins this scheme their membership will last 1 year before the membership expires and (unless they opt to cancel their membership) they will be expected to pay for the next year’s membership fees by direct debit. Please note, direct debit memberships are not renewed at the PoS (till) or online, like non direct debit memberships are. There is a separate MStore back office software process that needs to be run routinely (typically once a month) to bulk renew direct debit memberships in MStore ahead of their expiry (see the relevant section of this guide). (iv) The ‘Scheme Valid from’ and ‘Until’ options are to specify the date range when this membership scheme is available to be joined. This should not be confused with the ‘Duration’ (as explained above). Please note the ‘Scheme Valid from’ will default to today’s date, so theoretically people could sign up from today as this membership type but this can be set as required. In this scenario it was left as the ‘default’ date (i.e. the date on which you set the membership type up on), so someone could join this membership type immediately. Likewise set the ‘Scheme Valid Until’ date is set in exactly the same way to define when people can join this membership scheme until. If there is no known end date for this membership scheme (i.e. it will be offered indefinitely until further notice), set this to a date far into the future. In our example we will say this membership scheme is only available to join until 2030, so (using the same way as explained previously) the ‘Scheme Valid Until’ date for the was set to 31st December 2029. Once the ‘Scheme Valid from’ and ‘Scheme Valid Until’ dates have been specified, then outside of these dates this membership scheme will not be available for new members to join or existing members to renew to this scheme (either in-house or online). outside these dates. However, any members in this scheme will still be valid and can use their membership until the expiry date. They will just not be able to renew to this scheme outside the ‘Scheme Valid Until’ date. Please Note: Setting up member ‘Promotion’ and ‘Loyalty Schemes’ are both outside the scope of this guide and not covered in this guide. They are covered off in separate MStore guides and both Member Promotions and Loyalty Schemes (if required) should be set up prior to setting up your Membership Schemes. Please note both member ‘Promotion’ and ‘Loyalty Scheme’ options work at the MStore EPoS tills only, they do not work online. (v) In the ‘Promotion’ field you can assign up to three member promotions (if required) to a membership scheme. If a membership discount is applicable click the arrow icon and select the required membership promotion. This means that on swiping any valid (non-expired) member’s card that belongs to this membership scheme, then the specified promotion will be applied for that till transaction. The relevant member promotion must be set up prior to creating the membership scheme that it needs to be applied to. (vi) In the ‘Loyalty Scheme’ field you can assign one Loyalty Scheme (if required) to a membership scheme. If a loyalty scheme is applicable click the arrow icon and select the required loyalty scheme. This means that on swiping any valid (non-expired) member’s card that belongs to this membership scheme, then the specified loyalty scheme’s conditions will be applicable. The relevant points as applicable for that loyalty scheme will be collected when transactions are made. The option to spend any loyalty points will be offered automatically, and if the member opted to spend loyalty points then the relevant number of points are deducted. The set up of Loyalty Schemes is outside the scope of this manual and if you require more information or wish. For more information or a quote for training on how to set up the Loyalty Schemes then please contact your Customer Success Account Manager. (vii) For any membership that will allow direct debit payment, then you need to click the ‘Allow DD’ option so it is ticked’. (viii) Now select the ‘Initial DD Scheme’ that is required, using the drop-down menu. Please note per membership type you can decide the initial direct debit scheme for each membership type here. An example of the options that will be presented are shown below where Annual and Monthly direct debit schemes only have been created. Any direct debit schemes set up will appear as options in the drop down list The ‘Initial DD Scheme’ for a membership type can be set to any one of the Direct Debit schemes you created. For example for all new member sign ups you may want team to pay for the first year’s membership (as our example membership duration as set to 1 year) by one single, annual direct debit payment. To do this simply select the relevant direct debit scheme, e.g. the Annual Direct Debit Scheme could be selected. Alternatively if you wanted all members that sign up by direct debit to pay by 12 monthly payments for their first years membership (as our example membership duration as set to 1 year), then this select the relevant direct debit scheme, e.g. the Monthly Direct Debit Scheme could be selected. Please note there is also an option to select ‘Any’ in the ‘Initial DD Scheme’ drop down, which only really comes into play where more than one direct debit scheme has been set up. If 'Any' is selected, then when adding a direct debit membership \"in house\" in the Membership Wizard, then you can chose any of the 'Direct Debit Schemes' that have been set up. The till operator will need to ensure the required direct debit scheme is selected using the relevant dropdown. The same logic applies online, except no direct debit scheme is pre-selected online. When signing up online by direct debit the customer will have to select the required direct debit scheme, again they can select any of the direct debit schemes that have been set up. N.B. setting up online direct debit memberships is outside the scope of this manual as online direct debits (a) is chargeable additional module that first needs to be purchased from K3. In additional to purchasing the module (b) consultancy will also be required to advise and train you on your specific online direct debit set up requirements, as these vary per customer. If you do not already have this module please contact your Customer Success Account Manager for a quote for the module and the required training and consultancy. As standard when signing up direct debit in house (using the new Member Wizard at the till or via the back office software) the MStore user needs to ensure they select the required DD scheme from the direct debits schemes that have been set up. The in-house, new direct member sign up process is covered later in this guide. In this scenario it has been decided that the 1st years membership will need to be paid by a single annual direct debit payment, so the ‘Initial DD Scheme’ is set to the Annual Direct Debit Scheme. (ix) Once the initial direct debit scheme ends, you can then select the next type of direct debit scheme that this membership will be moved onto when the direct debits are renewed (by a process to bulk renewing direct debit memberships in advance of their expiry that is covered later in this guide. The direct debit scheme that this direct debit member will be moved to on renewal is known as the ‘Renewal DD Scheme’. This can be fixed by your organisation, for example if on renewal your terms and conditions are that all direct debit memberships have to pay monthly or annually, then the ‘Renewal DD Scheme’ can be fixed by your organisation as required (e.g. as the monthly direct debit scheme as required). If the customer was given the flexibility to choose the initial direct debit scheme on sign up, then the renewal direct debit scheme that a direct debit moves onto at renewal can be enforced to be a specific direct debit scheme for each membership type to meet tour business needs. To enforce this on renewal then set the ‘Renewal DD Scheme’ on each membership type to be as required. For example it may be that any renewing direct debit members must pay by monthly direct debit payment, then you would need to select the ‘Monthly Direct Debit Scheme’ as the ‘Renewal DD Scheme’ on each membership type you want to enforce this on. Alternatively, there is an option for the renewal direct debit scheme to be enforced to be the same as the initial direct debit scheme that was selected by that member. This is achieved by selecting the option ‘- Same Scheme - ’ as the ‘Renewal DD Scheme’ on each membership type where this needs to be enforced. The ‘Renewal DD Scheme’ is the direct debit scheme is the direct debit payment scheme for a memberships type is the direct payment scheme all the relevant members in that membership type will be moved onto when they are renewed (please refer to the relevant section of this guide for details). (x) The ‘Failed DD Grace period’ is the number of days “grace” you will give a direct debit member in this membership type if their direct debit payment fails before you take any action. For example you may expire their membership or perhaps even cancel their direct debt authorisation if no payment I made in this period. This is for your information purposes only and does not affect any functionality of the MStore direct debit memberships system currently. However you must enter a value between 1 and 99 in this box, otherwise you will not be able to only ‘Apply’ and save the changes to this direct debit membership type as this is mandatory data. The following three options are not specifically required to set a membership scheme to work with direct debits, so they will be covered briefly, as they are covered in the “in house” MStore memberships set up user guide. ‘Restrict Entries to:’ This is used to restrict the member entry to either a maximum number of times per day, and / or a maximum number of times per year as required. ‘Scheme Min Age’ and ‘Max Age’: These specify the minimum age and maximum age of members that can join this membership scheme (based on the date of birth entered for that member in the software). For this functionality to work, then ‘Date of Birth’ will need to be set as a mandatory requirement on this membership type. ‘If over max age, suggest this scheme:’ In conjunction with the above setting, if the members date of birth is over the maximum membership age, then the scheme (code) selected here will be suggested. For this functionality to work, then ‘Date of Birth’ will need to be set as a mandatory requirement on this membership type. Next you can select any PLU’s that to set up the membership scheme as required, the purpose of each of the required PLU’s is explained below. Creating PLU’s is outside the scope of this manual and is covered in other user guides. ‘Entry Fee:’ This is the PLU for the price charged for admission of this membership type (typically £0 price but may be or reduced priced PLU for member admission). PLU is set up in the usual way as you would set up any admission ticket PLU, but please ensure you select the PLU ‘Category’ of ‘Admission Ticket’ when creating the required PLU’s. This would typically be the PLU that records the member visit and footfall on scanning / swiping (depending on the hardware / card types purchased) / finding a member on an MStore till, so please ensure you set the footfall to be as required. The below PLU’s need to be added using the PLU ‘Category’ set to ‘Membership’. The below are membership prices or fees associated with signing up a membership, so generally footfall is only set on the above PLU used for member entry / re-admission. ‘Membership Price:’ This is the PLU for the full price the of the membership. For example if the member is £50 for the year, then this PLU needs to be set up with a price of £50. ‘Joining Fee:’ This is the PLU for joining fee value (if applicable). This is a one off fee applied on joining this membership type. This fee will be added to the initial amount to collect by direct debit, but will not be charged on membership renewal. ‘Renewal Discount:’ This is the PLU for the renewal discount value (if applicable) that will be applied on membership renewal. The discount will apply to all members in a membership type and will be applied on renewal. For direct debit memberships this amount will be deducted from amount to be paid by direct debit on membership renewal. Please note for the ‘Renewal Discount’ there is the ability to specify for how many renewals the renewal discount will apply for. If it is only to apply for X renewals then (i) click the box next to ‘No Discount after X Renewals:’ so that is ticked, then (ii) enter the required number of renewal that the discount will apply for in the box, for example 1 if the discount will only be applied the first time they renew the membership only. ‘Initial DD Fee:’ The initial direct debit fee is a one-off “up front” fee that can be taken on signing up to a membership scheme by direct debit. For example, you may want to take an amount “up front” not by direct debit (e.g. by a debit / credit card payment) rather than the whole amount by direct debit. This is often used to cover the fact that someone could potentially become a member and select to pay by direct debit and visit your attraction, but cancel their direct debit with the bank before their first payment date. This one-off “up front” fee can be set to whatever value you want for each different direct debit membership type (e.g. the “up front” fee for a child direct debit membership could be £5, whereas for the adult direct debit membership could be £10). You will need to create a PLU for each of the different “up front” fees you require and when creating the PLU’s please ensure the PLU ‘Category’ you select is ‘Membership’ for the various direct debit fee values you require. Please note even if you do not require any “up front” direct debit fee, then the software will require a £0 value PLU to be created and selected as the Initial DD Fee. To do this click on the relevant arrow button to select the required ‘Initial DD Fee’ PLU. Use the search facility to find the required PLU (e.g. enter code and click ‘Search’). If there is only one result the PLU will be highlighted already, or if there are multiple results click on the required PLU, so it is highlighted yellow. Next click on the ‘Use Selected PLU’ button. Check all the required and correct PLU’s have been assigned to this direct membership type as require. As a quick visual check the price of the selected PLU’s appear in the relevant boxes next to where a PLU is selected. To check the actual PLU that is assigned is correct click on the button next to the PLU price to view the PLU. If a PLU selected is incorrect first click the button to clear the selected PLU. Re-select it as detailed previously. Click the ‘Apply’ button to accept any changes. There are other settings on this screen that are outlined below: Imagine Discount: Out scope of this manual as this only applies to customers with an integration to part of the K3 Imagine software suite. This option will be explained to / required but only customers with the relevant integration. Allow Selling on Internet. As per the reasons mentioned previously setting up direct debits to sell online is outside of the scope of this manual. Count Footfall Per Transaction. This option either is to the make system count customer visits either per group (one visit per transaction regardless of number of people) or per each transaction line that involved customer entry. Welcome Letter: The required Microsoft Word mail merge template document can be selected here using thebutton, which opens a file explorer window for you to select the required file. Please note this will require you to have Microsoft word installed by your IT team and to also to have had training in MStore on how to create mail merge templates by adding merge fields (e.g. name, address details, membership type, membership expiry date etc) into existing Word documents. This training is outside the scope of this manual and is covered in a separate guide. Once this is set up, then on signing up a member you will be able to print welcome / sign up letters to a Windows Printer that is networked to your tills. Your IT team will need to ensure the printer is set up / available on the same network as your MStore tills. Mandatory Items Per membership type you can click in the tick box to make Title (salutation), Date of Birth, Gender or Photo as mandatory requirements (the latter will require compatible web cameras to have been installed on you tills by K3). Tick these as required then these will become mandatory when using the ‘Member Wizard’. Please note further mandatory options can be defined in Setup > System > System Options on the Membership tab. There are options to set the Address, Town, Postcode, Telephone, Email and Account Source as mandatory as required. However, these mandatory options set in System Options will be mandatory for all membership types. Once all you have finished all the set-up for this direct membership type, click on ‘Apply’ button to save the changes. Repeat the processes detailed above to create all the direct debit membership schemes (types) as required. Click on ‘Close’ once you have finished creating all the required membership schemes. Signing Up New Members at the Till – New Member Wizard Login to an MStore EPoS till that has the ‘New Member’ button on it and click on this button. Please Note: Someone may have renamed this button on your till. If so, please ask your colleagues what this button is called. If you do not have the button on your till then ask one of your colleagues in your organisation to add this button to your tills screens. For your information is the ‘Command’ type button and you need to select the specific command called ‘New Member Wizard’ but you can name (colour /size) and position this button as required. The ‘New Member Wizard’ screen will appear as shown below. Where pre-printed, barcoded member cards have been purchased from your preferred plastic card suppliers, then simply type in the member card number from the card into the ‘Swipe Card’ box. Alternatively if the till has a barcode scanner then you can scan the barcode for the member card number on the card to populate the ‘Swipe Card’ field with the member card number. Alternatively for customers that have member card printers that are connected to their MStore tills then the members card numbers will be automatically generated. In this scenario then the ‘Swipe Card’ field will show the word ‘Auto’ and there will be no need to type in / scan the member card number, as the member card number will automatically be generated by MStore and printed onto the member card. Next, enter the members ‘Postcode’, ‘House Name/No’ and ‘Surname’ as required, then click ‘Next’. Please note the Surname is the surname of who this membership is being purchased for. You will notice some of the details from the previous screen have now populated into this screen. The ‘Card Number’ has populated the relevant field (next to the text ‘Swipe Card’). The ‘Surname’ box has also been populated with name of the person this membership is for. This data can be corrected at this stage if any errors were made, by editing the data in the specific field. If required pick the ‘Title’ from the dropdown list of options. Please note if ‘Title’ has been set to mandatory it will be required, if not then it will be optional to select this. If the title does not already exist in the dropdown the new ‘Title’ can just be typed in as required. In the ‘First Names’ box enter the first name / names of who this membership is for. Next, select the required direct debit ‘Memb Type’ (membership type) from the drop-down list. In this scenario the ‘Adult Direct Debit Membership’ type we created earlier has been selected. Please note the ‘Start Date’ will default to today’s date and the ‘Expires’ date will be calculated. The calculation is based on the ‘Duration’ of the membership you selected for this membership type). If the start date is not today this can be amended as required and the software will automatically recalculate the ‘Expires’ date based on the new date entered. But please note if the member tries to enter before this date the till will display a warning message as shown below. The till operator can then decide based on your own policies whether they are to be admitted, then click ‘Yes’ or 'No’ as is appropriate. If required the gender can then be selected if required by clicking an option where shown. There are options of ‘Unknown’, ‘Male’ or ‘Female’. Select as /if required Next there is date of birth, if this is not mandatory then there is no need to select the date. However, if this has been set to mandatory or is optional for the customer to provide this then you will need to select the date of birth. If the ‘Date of birth’ is required click on the tick box the right of the text ‘Over 18’, so the box is un-ticked. Click on the dropdown where shown and select the required date of birth using the calendar that appears. A calendar will appear. If you click on the text for the year at the top of this date selector screen If you click on the text for the year at the top of this date selector screen then up / down arrows appear. Click the arrows to the right of the year to select the year as required. Similarly can select the month by clicking on the text for the month, then a month selector appears Simply click on the required month from the month pop up selector to select it. Finally select the required date from the calendar by clicking on it, in this case the 1st (of January) was selected. The selected birth date will now be showing in the ‘Date of Birth’ field. Alternatively if you prefer and it can be quicker for entering the date, first click on the year so it is highlighted. Type in the year in 4 digit (YYYY) format, e.g. type in 1980. Next click on the month so it is highlighted then enter the month number (1 for January up to 12 for December). Finally, click on the day of the month so it is highlighted then enter the required number. Once selected then check that the correct date of birth is showing in the ‘Date of Birth’ field. Please note by default the first member added will have the ‘Prime Contact’ tick box ticked. If required then a member photo can also be taken. This will need compatible web cameras to have been purchased from K3 and installed on all the tills these are required on. If you are interested in having web cameras installed for taking member photos on your tills (or back office computers), then please contact your Customer Success Account Manager. To take a photo using a web camera first click the ‘Preview’ button. Get the member to stand in front of the camera and check that they are positioned where required. Click the ‘Capture’ button to take the photo and check the photo is as required. If not click ‘Preview’ button again and repeat until the required photo is seen in the ‘Photograph’ window. This photo will be shown at the till when the member card is scanned and can be seen in the MStore software. N.B this photo can also be viewed in the member record in the MStore back office software, where it can be deleted and a new member photo could also be taken if that computer also has a compatible web camera installed. Click on the ‘Next’ button. You will now see the member details showing in the bottom half of this screen. N.B. for this guide the scenario we will use is one member, paying for their own membership by direct debit. However, you can sign up other family members that will pay by direct debit at the same time. In the above scenario pre-printed member card are used, so the ‘Swipe Card’ field will now be blank. To add a new member then you take a new card and then scan / swipe the card (depending on the member card type and till hardware purchased) or key in the new member card number to populate the ‘Swipe Card’ field with the next card number. Then repeat the steps detailed previously starting from the ‘Title’ selection. Important note: where multiple family members are being signed up by direct debit in MStore then all the membership expiry dates of the family members must be the same. Please note there is a 'System Option' that can be enabled to remind you that all family members should have the same expiry date. This can be found in Setup > System > System Options, then click on the 'Membership' tab. Click the option shown so that it is ticked and click 'Apply' to accept this change. You will now be prompted if members in a family have different expiry dates. Where a member card printer has been purchased the ‘Swipe Card’ field would not be blank but would instead show the word ‘Auto’. To add another family member that will pay by direct debit, then likewise repeat the steps detailed previously starting from the ‘Title’ selection. Once all the member names are showing in the bottom half of the screen, click the ‘Next’ button to proceed. You will now be at the above screen. The below screen will be showing and is for entering the ‘Account Billing Address’. So this screen is where you enter the details of the person that is paying for these memberships. You will notice some of the fields will have been automatically populated from data entered in previous screens. E.g. the ‘Account Name’ has been populated (with the member surname) but this can be amended if required. Click in the ‘Email’ field and type in the required email address. This can be left blank if it was not set to be mandatory, however you may still prefer to ask the customer for this. If it was set as mandatory then an entry will be required in this field ( a red * shows to the left of mandatory fields) If this field was set to mandatory but the customer does not have or declines to provide an email address, then only an entry of ‘none’ will be accepted in this in box (i.e. a blank entry will NOT be accepted). You can click and type into the address field and enter the address line 1. Then click on the next line and enter address line 2 etc. Alternatively click the ‘Address’ button and the following screen appears. This screen can be used to key in the address fields but will be used by those customers who have purchased the post code look up software integration.Please note for customers who have purchased the post code look up software integration only, the ‘Search’ button (o the right of the ‘Post Code’) field will not be greyed out. For those customers first enter the post code, then click ‘Search’ button. This will bring up a list of all the addresses that match the post code. You simply then select the relevant one and the other information will be automatically populated. For more details on the post code lookup software integration contact your Account Manager. For customers without the postcode lookup software integration, the search button to the right of the ‘Post Code’ field will be greyed out and the relevant address details will need to be entered using a keyboard. The cursor defaults to the ‘House + Street’ field. Enter the house number and street using your keyboard. Enter the first address line using your keyboard. If a second address line is required press the ‘Enter’ key on your keyboard, then type this in. Repeat the above if a 3rd or 4th address line is required. However, please note there are separate fields for entering town / city , county and post code. You now need to populate the remaining data by clicking in the relevant field and entering the data as required. ‘Town/City:’ click in (or use the ‘Tab’ key to go down to) this field and type in the town / city as required. ‘County’: click in (or use the ‘Tab’ key to go down to) this field and type in the county as required. ‘Post Code’: click in (or use the ‘Tab’ key to go down to) this field and type in the post code as required. ‘Email: click in (or use the ‘Tab’ key to go down to) this field and type in the email address as required. Click the ‘Ok’ button once all the required data has been entered Next (if required) click in the ‘Telephone’ filed and type in the appropriate telephone number. Next you must select a single Account ‘Source’ from the dropdown menu of options. This is essentially used to “tag” this record with a specific ‘Account Source’ as required by your business. The list of options in the ‘Account ‘Source’ dropdown is set up and controlled by your business (this is done in set up in Setup > System > Lookup Items > Account Source). Likewise there is the ability to tag this customer record with multiple ‘Account Flags’. This is again a list of options that is user definable, which is set up and controlled by your business (this list of options is set up in Setup > System > Lookup Items > Account Flags). These could be e.g. to record a customer wants to receive newsletter and is happy to be contacted about volunteering (or both as multiple ‘Account Flags’ can be selected). Elsewhere in MStore (‘Member Mailing’) can use this information to extract lists of customers that have specific ‘Account Source’ or ‘Account Flags’ and these lists can be used to start a Word mail merge or the data can be exported in Microsoft Excel. Please refer to the separate user guide or contact your Customer Success Account Manager for a quote. If required, amend the ‘Addressee’ and ‘Dear’ text as required (these were automatically populated). These fields are specifically used as the ‘Addressee’ and ‘Dear’ name for mail merges, as MStore has functionality to select specific member records and then start a mail merge to those specific members using Microsoft Word. How to set up mail merge templates and using the ‘Member Mailing’ functionality are covered in a separate user guide. Please note although in this guide we will be using the scenario where the purchaser is buying the membership for themselves, if the purchaser was buying for someone else, then this box can be ticked labelled ‘This is a gift or Member at a different Address’. When the previous screen has been completed and the ‘Next’ button is clicked when option ‘This is a gift or Member at a different Address’ had been ticked, then an additional screen would be seen like the one shown below. This allows you then to enter who the membership was being purchased for. If the account holder (purchaser) lives at the same address as the person they are buying the membership for, click the ‘Same Address’ button to populate this form. For this guide we will proceed without the option ‘This is a gift or Member at a different Address’ being ticked. So once all the information has been entered into the below screen then it will not proceed to the above screen, as the option ‘This is a gift or Member at a different Address’ was unticked. Click ‘Next’ will proceed to the screen as shown on the next page. Please Note: The following screen is based on customers having the GDPR functionality in place. For customers without the GDPR functionality in place then there will just be two tick box options in the top right of the above screen. There will be one tick box for ‘Ok to Mail’ and another for ‘Ok to Mail’ that can be ticked as required. These are the old pre-GDPR mailing options for the customer mailing preferences which have now been superseded by an the GDPR module which allows you to design your own GDPR options which enable you to select the relevant GDPR options both in-house and online. Please contact your Account Manager for more details on the GDPR module functionality and training. Now click on the GDPR options for that customer so they are ticked. If the customer wishes to opt out of all contact then simply click the ‘Do not make contact’ option so that it is ticked. If they are not opting out then you will need to select the relevant GDPR options. Please note as standard there are three sections of GDPR options (i) Reason for Customer Data (ii) How the customer data is used (iii) Who can use the Customer data. You will have to select at least one option from each section, so click in the relevant box(es) to select the customer’s GDPR preferences. Please note for speed if a customer want to opt in to all options in a section click the ‘Select All’ box. Once the required GDPR options have been selected click on the ‘Next’ button. The below screen now appears in which you can select the information required to set up the direct debit. First select the required ‘DD Scheme’ where shown using the dropdown. N.B. is very important you check that the correct direct debit scheme is selected here All direct debit schemes that have been set up in MStore will be available from this dropdown. Use the dropdown to select the required initial direct debit scheme. Check this is correct before proceeding. Selecting the wrong direct debt scheme will impact the number and date of collections. It can also impact the payment amounts, as the direct debit scheme selected can apply a discount. Once the correct initial direct debit scheme is selected and has been checked, then proceed entering the other data. Please note the software automatically fills in the ‘Number of Payments’ and the ‘Day of Month’ on which the payment will be taken, based on the ‘DD Scheme’ you selected. Likewise, in the bottom right hand corner of this screen the payment ‘Collection Date’(s)are shown, these are also based on the ‘DD Scheme’ you selected. Please check again these are correct because if not it likely you selected the wrong direct debit scheme (or perhaps you have set up the direct debit scheme incorrectly if you are still testing your setup) Next you need to click in each field required for taking payment by direct debit. These will need to be supplied by the customer, so they will need to have these details to hand. Click in each field and type in the details required. Field descriptions are given below: A/C Holders Name: Enter the account holders name exactly as per their bank account. Sort Code: Enter the sort code exactly as per their bank account (6 digits) Account Number: Enter the bank account number exactly as per their bank account (8 digits). Account Reference: Enter the reference for this payment This will be the reference on their bank statements (18 characters maximum) Bank: The bank name exactly as per their bank account (25 characters maximum) Please note a breakdown of the “up front” and any other payments and the total amount to be collected by direct debit is broken down on the right hand side. These amounts shown in this screen will depend on the set up detailed in previous sections of this manual. Once you have checked and amended the details as required, then click ‘Next’. If you wish to deduct the customer’s day ticket price, then you can do this using the ‘Already Paid’ box. The simplest way to deduct the day ticket price is to type in the required amount to deduct in the ‘Already Paid’ box, e.g. enter 10.00 in this box to deduct £10.00). If there was a value in the ‘Amount to pay now’ box you will notice this has now been automatically reduced by the value entered in the ‘Already Paid’ box. Plus the 'Remaining to pay:' and 'Amount' figures are deducted accordingly. Alternatively, you can look up the customer’s transaction to find the amount ‘Already Paid’, to do you will need the customer’s receipt. To do this click on the ‘Find Txn’ button You will now see the following screen. Find the till number and transaction number from the customer’s receipt. Enter the till number in ‘Till No:’ box (e.g. 1) and enter the transaction number in the ‘TXN No:’ box (e.g. 768848). Next click on the ‘Search’ button. You will now see the transaction lines showing on the screen You need to select the item you required by clicking on thebutton, to the right of the item. When you do this, you will notice that this now turns to a tick You will notice the ‘Already Paid’ box is now populated with the amount you selected. Next click the ‘Finish’ button here at the bottom of the screen. You will now be at the screen shown below. Confirm the details are correct and make any changes as required. Once all the details are correct, click the ‘Next’ button. If this membership was set up so it can be gift aided then you need to ensure the 'Gift Aid' option is set as required. Click on the 'Gift Aid' tick box to toggle this on/off as required - ticked is gift aid on / unticked is gift aid off. The gift aid claim date can be amended as required if you are e.g. retrospectively signing up members on the till. If a ‘Welcome Letter’ was selected when you set up this membership type, then you will see a button to the right of the text ‘Print Welcome Letter?’ When the tick button is showing the 'Welcome Letter' will be printed. If you do not require the ‘Welcome Letter’ to be printed click on theand it will change to a When the is button showing, this means that a ‘Welcome Letter’ will not be printed Please note that a ‘Welcome Letter’ must first be created as Microsoft mail merge template document. The creation of Microsoft mail merge template documents is covered in a separate manual. Once the required options have been selected click the ‘Finish’ button. If you selected the option to print a ‘Welcome Letter’ this document will not be printed automatically. The ‘Welcome Letter’ to print this will now open in the background in Microsoft Word, as long as Microsoft Word has been installed on this computer. Please note that installing and supporting Microsoft Word is not carried out by K3, this must be done by your own IT Department or external IT support company. If installed, click on the Microsoft Word icon on the taskbar to view and print this letter as required. If you (i) have a member card printer attached that was supplied and installed by K3 and (ii) your membership type(s) in MStore have been configured to print member cards, then you will now see a screen asking you to select your member card printer. This is the standard Microsoft Windows printer selection screen, simply select the member card printer and ensure the quantity to print is as required, then tap the ‘Print’ button. The till basket will show the total of all the fees expected even if they are paying by direct debit. Press ‘Subtotal’ button as usual to show the payment methods. If 'Gift Aid' was selected then you will now be presented with the 'Enter Gift Aid Details' screen. The amount to pay will only be any \"up-front\" fees that must be paid at this point (e.g. the ‘Initial DD Fee’ if applicable). (i) If there are no payments necessary, you can press the ‘Cash’ button to complete the transaction. (ii) If there are any payments required, simply complete the transaction as usual, by taking the required amount using one of the payment methods you have available (e.g. Credit Card, Cash etc). In this scenario there were no up front payments and the £40 showing in the basket is to be paid by direct debit, so the 'Cash' button was pressed as the 'Amount to Pay' is £0. If there was any e.g. \"up front fees\" to pay that will not be paid for by direct debit, the 'Amount to Pay' will be populated with the money that needs to be paid \"up front\". If there was no amount to pay click the 'Ok' button twice to complete the transaction, pay the expected amount in the usual way. The below message will appear. Close the cash drawer in the usual way or tap this screen and this message disappears. N.B. the member record(s) have now been created and can be found in the ‘Member’ database in MStore. It is not necessary to find the member in the database at this point but for your information finding and amending member details is covered later in this guide. Creating and Submitting the Initial Submission Instruction Please note that for newly created members that have opted to use direct debits, before any direct debit payments can be taken a process needs to be carried out to both check that the bank account details that these members provided are correct and to set up the direct debit with the bank. This type of submission does not take any money from these members’ bank accounts and is known as the “Initial Instruction Submission” in MStore. A very brief overview of this process is given below: (i) A file containing direct debit account details for checking is created using MStore. (ii) This file is submitted by you to the bank electronically. (iii) Your bank checks the details, which may take several days. (iv) Your bank provides a response to say which accounts are OK and which are not. The only part of the above process that is required in MStore, is to create the “Initial Instruction Submission” file. Please supply K3 with the preferred location of this file, so we can specify this location in the MStore software for you. This procedure to create this file in the MStore back office software is explained below: 1. Click Setup > 2. Click Customer > 3. Double click Direct Debit Submissions You will now see the screen below. Now click on the button ‘Generate Initial Instruction Submission’ button. This shows the account details for all members whose accounts need checking by your bank. At this point click on the ‘Save’ button. Now click on the ‘Create Submission File’ button, at the bottom left of the screen. At this point, the submission file is created as a text file, which should open in Microsoft Notepad. The file will be in the format of the example shown above. Please note in some versions of Windows this file may not show automatically on your screen. If not, then look on your Windows ‘Taskbar’ and click on the icon to view the file. Please note – DO NOT make any changes to this text file! Please make a note of the filename in the top left corner of the above screen (in this example it is BACSUB001.TXT), as you need to submit this specific file to your bank. This file will be automatically saved in the location you specified. From the main menu in simply select ‘File’ button. Now click the ‘Exit’ button at the bottom of the dropdown. Alternatively click the cross button in the top right corner. Now you need to submit this file electronically to your bank. N.B. K3 cannot advise you on this process of how to submit the “Initial Instruction Submission” file to your bank. You will need to consult your bank and they must inform you as to how you submit this file electronically. Once you have submitted the file to your bank all you need to do in MStore is to record: (i) the date that this file was submitted to your bank and (ii) the person who made the submission. Use the ‘Submitted to BACS On:” drop-down selector select the date you submitted this file to the bank. Use the drop-down selector here to select the person that submitted this file to the bank. Once you selected the required click on the ‘Save’ button at the bottom right of the screen. Now simply click on the ‘Close’ button at the bottom right of the screen. As you aware this process submits the account details of new members for checking. However, whenever you either update or edit the account details of an existing member in MStore that pays by direct debit, this process also submits these account details for checking. Please note that this check batch will not take any money from these members’ bank accounts. For this reason, it is recommended that you carry out the submission of the “Initial Instruction Submission” file to your bank every week. This is so that you are informed by the bank as soon as possible as to any bank account issues. You now wait until you get notification from the bank as to whether the direct debit ‘initial instruction submission’ has been approved or rejected. Please consult with your bank about how long this procedure will take them to carry out and how they notify you as to whether the ‘initial instruction submission’ has been approved or rejected. K3 cannot advise you on this process. For your information, the bank normally refers to these results as the Advice of Direct Debit Amendments and Cancellations (also referred to as ADDACS). Once you receive these ADDACS results from your bank you need to go into MStore and mark which accounts were OK and which account were not OK. Marking Accounts as Ok / Not Ok - After Receiving ADDACS When you receive the ADDACS results from the bank, go back into ‘Direct Debit Submissions’: 1. Click Setup > 2. Click Customer > 3. Double click Direct Debit Submissions All your direct debit submissions will show in this screen. Initial submission instructions that were created will show in the ‘Type’ column as ‘A/C Check’. Double click on the relevant initial submission instruction that you need to process. As seen previously this will open a screen showing all the accounts details of the members that were included in that “Initial Submission Instruction” submission batch. You then need to click on the relevant account, so it is highlighted yellow. Now right mouse click on the selected account to bring up the options (as shown above). For each account where the direct debit received the banks approval, select ‘Mark Account as Ok’. You will see the above message pop up - click ‘OK’ to confirm this change. Repeat the procedure until all the required accounts are marked. For all accounts where ‘Mark Account as Ok’ was selected, you are now able to generate a submission file. Proceed to section entitled “How to Generate a New Submission”. Please note for speed if ALL accounts were ok, you can just click the ‘Mark All Accounts as Ok’ at the bottom of the screen. But if you do this you then please remember you WILL NOT be able to undo this from this screen, or use the ‘Mark Account as Not Ok’ option (explained next) for any account in this initial instruction submission batch. Alternatively, where the bank declines an account in the check batch, right click the required member’s account. This will bring up the options (as shown below). Select ‘Mark Account as Not OK’. Click ‘OK’ to confirm this change. For all the above accounts, you now must check and correct the member(s) bank account details See the next section that covers with how to Deal with 'Accounts that Fail the ‘Initial Submission Instruction’. If there were no ADDAC’s failures, please proceed to the section 'How to ‘Generate a New Submission’ (Taking Payment)'. Accounts that Fail the ‘Initial Submission Instruction’ For all accounts where the ‘Mark Account as Not OK’ was selected you must go back to the member(s) and inform them that the bank rejected the initial instruction submission. For each member where the bank rejected the initial instruction submission, they need to confirm that both the bank account details that they provided were correct. If there are any amendments that need to be made, then these must be made in the ‘Member Details’ screen. This is most easily accessed while you still have the below screen open. Right click any member where the ‘Mark Account as Not Ok’ option was selected and then left click ‘Edit Member’ option . The below screen appears. Click on the ‘Direct Debit’ tab. N.B. for any member’s account where ‘Mark Account as Not OK’ was selected, you will notice that the status here now appears as ‘A/C Invalid’. Amend the details (e.g. ‘Name of Account Holder’, ‘Sort Code’ and ‘A/C Number’ etc) in this screen as required. Click ‘OK’ once the required information has been entered. You will now notice the status of this account will now change from ‘A/C Invalid’ to ‘Not Checked’. Next click the ‘Close’ button. For all accounts whose status is now ‘Not Checked’, follow the procedure in the section entitled 'Creating and Submitting the Initial Submission Instruction'. How to ‘Generate a New Submission’ (Taking Payment) For all accounts where ‘Mark Account as Ok’ was selected, it is now possible to initiate the procedure to submit this information that instructs your bank to collect these direct debit payments. To do this, click on ‘Generate New Submission’ button. You must now specify the date up to which you are collecting the direct debit payments for. This is done using the ‘Payments up to and including’ drop-down selection. Click on the drop-down arrow then select the required date from the calendar. Please Note: You should consult your bank as to when you need to carry out your direct debit submission by. For example, you want to carry out a submission every month for ‘Payments up to and including’ the last day of that specific month. Your bank may specify that in order to have sufficient time to process this request this submission must be carried out and submitted to them sent by e.g. the 14th of each month. This means that you may have to carry out the above process on e.g. the 14th of each month but select ‘Payments up to and including’ date as the last day of that month. Once you have selected the required ‘Payments up to and including’ date, then click on the ‘Go’ button. You are now asked if you want to generate a new submission file to the bank for the date criteria selected (referred to as a “DD Batch”). Then click on ‘OK’ to proceed with creating the submission file. If there are direct debits due for collection for the date selected, then you will see the following message. Then click on ‘OK’. N.B. if there are no direct debits to submit for the selected period, the following screen appears. Click ‘Click ‘OK’ if you see this screen. Assuming there were direct debits to collect, you will now see the following screen. This shows the each member’s bank account and payment details that will be included in the submission file. Next click the ‘Create Submission File’ button. The submission file is created as a text file, which should open in Microsoft Notepad (sample content given below). The file will be in the format of the example shown above. As stated previously in some versions of Microsoft Windows this file may not show automatically on screen. If so then look on your Windows ‘Taskbar’ and click on the Notepad icon to view the file. Please note - do not make any changes to this text file! Please make a note of the filename at the top of the screen, in this case it is BACSUB001.txt. You need to submit this specific file to your bank for this submission. Please note the number at the end of the filename (BACSUB001.txt) relates to the batch number in MStore (in the above screenshot this filename is for Batch 1 in MStore). This file will be automatically saved in the location you specified previously. (as defined in Setup > System > System Options > Membership tab > Direct Debit Submissions Folder) From the main menu in simply select ‘File’ button. Now click the ‘Exit’ button at the bottom of the dropdown (alternatively click the cross in the top right corner). Please note that unlike the Initial Instruction Submission’ “check batch”, once you submit this batch to the bank this will initiate the process to try and collect direct debit payments from these member’s bank accounts! Do not submit this file to your bank unless you have checked the contents of this batch are correct. Now you need to submit this file electronically to your bank. K3 cannot advise you on this process of how and when to submit this file to your bank. You will need to consult your bank and they must inform you as to how you submit this file electronically. Once you have submitted the file to your bank all you need to do in MStore is to record: (i) the date that this file was submitted to your bank and (ii) the person who made the submission. Use the ‘Submitted to BACS On:’ drop-down selector to select the date you submitted this file to the bank. Select today’s date or if this was not submitted today, select the required date from the calendar. Next use the ‘Submitted to BACS By:’ drop-down selector to record who submitted this file to the bank. Click on the drop-down arrow here and select the required back office ‘User’ from the list. Once the required date and user name has been selected, click the ‘Save’ button (which will now be active). Next click the ‘Close’ button. Marking Accounts as ‘Ok’/‘Not Ok’ after receiving ARUDDS When you receive the ARUDDS (Automatic Return of Unpaid Direct Debits) from bank: 1. Click Setup > 2. Click Customer > 3. Double click Direct Debit Submissions. All your direct debit submissions will show in this screen. New submissions that were created will show in the ‘Type’ column as ‘Normal’. Double click on the relevant submission that you need to process. This will open a screen showing all the accounts details of the members that were included in that submission. You will notice that in the ‘Note’ column these show as ‘Outstanding’. This is because these are direct debit payments that are awaiting you to confirm that have been paid. Now click on the ‘Mark All Payments as Ok’ button. A message will appear confirming the number of records updated. Click 'Ok'. You will see the that each direct debit payment record has now changed to ‘Paid’ in the ‘Note’ column. Now for any direct debit payment that failed collection, right mouse click on the payment. Now with a left mouse click, select ‘Mark Payment as Failed’. Repeat the procedure until all the accounts are marked as required. For all people whose direct debit payment failed, please note that K3 cannot give you the explanation for the failure. You would have to contact your bank directly for the reason for direct debit payment failures. Once you have contacted your bank you would need to contact the member(s) concerned, e.g. to confirm their bank account details, take payment by another method (e.g. cash, cheque or credit card) , or arrange for an increased/additional direct debit payment to be set up to cover the failed payment. The payment may have failed due the customer changing their bank account details since they were originally provided. Checking and amending bank account details is covered later in this guide. If the failed payment needs to be taken on a till you would need an appropriately named PLU to be set up in in MStore (e.g. ‘Failed DD Payment’), which must be set up with the ‘Override Price’ set to ‘Forced Price Entry’. You would then use the ‘Find Member’ button on the till to find the member before selling the ‘Failed DD Payment’ PLU to the required method of payment. Please note setting up PLU’s and till buttons is not covered in the scope of this manual. Alternatively a member might want to: (i) cancel the membership, direct debit instruction and any outstanding payments. (ii) re-schedule the direct debit payment for the next convenient date as required. Both these processes are covered later in this guide. Please note in this screen you can also cancel the direct debit and membership in the below screen. Simply right click the required record and select the ‘Cancel D/D and Membership’ option. At the next screen click the ‘Yes’ button. This will cancel their direct debit authorisation, any outstanding payments and also expire their membership. Once you have finished in this screen click ‘Close’ then ‘Close’ again to exit the ‘Direct Debits’ screen. Alternatively, if you do not find out at this point that a customer wants to cancel, the process of cancelling a direct debit is explained in the following section. Dealing with Members no Longer Paying by Direct Debit For each member who responds confirming they do not want to continue to pay for their membership via direct debit, you need to amend that member’s record to reflect this. Find and open this member’s record and access the direct debit details (as explained in previous sections). Next click the ‘Cancel Authorisation’ button. At the following screen click 'Yes' (or click 'No' if you do not want to do this now). Any payments that were outstanding will now be marked 'Payment Cancelled' (see ‘Current Payments’ section of screen). You should now also click on the drop down here and select ‘A/C Invalid’. Next click the ‘OK’ button (at the bottom of the screen) to accept this change. You will notice that the information in the ‘History’ section has updated to show these actions. You will notice that the information in the ‘History’ section has updated to show these actions. You now must ensure you change the ‘Expires On’ date. This could be set to today’s date or a past and future date. This really depends on your terms and conditions as to when their membership expires on cancelling a direct debit. Click the ‘Ok’ button to accept the change. Repeat the process for each member as required. Editing Direct Debit Payments There may be the need to change the direct payment schedule for a member. Common examples would be to e.g. amend the value of a current payment, create a totally new payment, or change the status of a current payment. These scenarios are explained below. Important Note: Although the MStore software has the flexibility to allows you to amend / add direct debit payment please first check with your direct debits expert and / or your bank whether you are legally allowed to amend a direct debit payment and what consent / documentation you may legally require to do so. First find and open the member record and click on the ‘Direct Debit’ tab. Next click on the ‘Edit’ button. Please note when adding or removing or amending direct debit payments it is optional whether this will create a transaction in MStore which will post a +ve or -ve adjustment to a specified till in MStore. If this is required please contact your Customer Success Account Manager for a quote for the necessary configuration and training to enable this functionality (also see below *). By default no transaction will be made on adding / adjusting / cancelling direct debit payments, unless this functionality have been previously enabled. You can click on any existing payment so it is highlighted, then amend the details as required. Click 'Save' once the required changes are made. The fields that can be amended are: Collection date: Use the date drop-down selector to select the required date for this payment. Collection Amount: Amend the amount in this box to be as required. Transaction Type: Use the date drop-down selector to select from the available options as required. (i.e. ‘First Collection’, ‘Normal Collection, ‘Represented Collection’, or ‘Final Collection’) ‘Status’: Click the required status to select from the available options as required. (i.e. ‘Outstanding’, ‘Paid’, ‘Payment Failed’, or ‘Payment Cancelled’). Please not you can also remove a payment. Click on the payment so that it is highlighted yellow, then click on the button. If required you can also create a totally new direct debit payment. To do this click on the ‘New’ button to create a new payment. Enter the required details and check these, then click 'Save'. Once all the payments in this screen have been amended as required, click ‘Close’. Please note (see above*) if on clicking 'Close' you see a message (like the one below) stating that either a positive or negative adjustment has been posted. This means you have the setup already in place that is creating a positive or negative adjustment that will be reflected in your transaction reports for the date you made the adjustment. At the next ('Member Details') screen click ‘Close’ again to return to the main ‘Members’ screen. Direct Debit Renewals To carry out direct debit renewals click on the ‘Members’ button then the ‘Renew DDs’ button. You now must select the required date criteria for the direct debit memberships you want to renew. (i) ‘Renewal all Direct Debit members expiring on or before’. Select the membership expiry date for direct debt memberships that you want to renew. For most organisations that offer direct debits this is typically a date several weeks ahead of today’s date, as this process is typically carried out several weeks in advance. The exact number of weeks in advance of the expiry will need to be decided by your own organisation’s requirements, but could be e.g. we six weeks in advance of the membership expiry dates. For example, for all customers whose direct debits memberships are due to expire on or before the 31st of December, then you may want to carry out process should be carried out in e.g. mid-October. This is to allow adequate time for any direct debit letters to be sent, received and responses returned by your direct debit members and then any action to be taken in MStore as required. (ii) ‘Direct Debit Scheme’ Next select the required direct debit scheme you want to run renewals for. This will default to ‘Renew All Schemes’. For those customers who offer multiple direct debit payment schemes (e.g. annual and monthly),if required you can run the renewals process separately. However many customers have only a single direct debit scheme, or are happy to run the renewal for all direct debit schemes (for the expiry date selected in step 1). Select as required for the way you want to control and run the direct debit renewals process. (iii) ‘Show All Direct Debits for Renewal’ Once steps 1 and 2 have been done and checked, click the ‘Show All Direct Debits for Renewal’ button to see the memberships that will be renewed. Please note clicking this does not carry out the renewal itself. This allows you to view and check the direct debit memberships that would be renewed if you carry out the relevant steps to renew the members displayed when you click the ‘Show All Direct Debits for Renewal’ button. 1. You will now see the direct memberships that will be renewed. 2. If required you can click the extra options which will add extra data into the grid (if applicable) ‘Show All Members’ Clicking this will show all the members being paid for by direct debit (where applicable) under each bank account. It is quite normal for two or more memberships being paid for by direct debit from one person’s bank account, as in MStore you can sign up multiple membership at a time under one “family” account. ‘Show All Columns’ This adds extra columns of data into he results which may be required. Export to Excel Once the required options are selected and before the renewal has been completed, then (if required) the records that are about to be renewed can be exported to Microsoft (MS) Excel at this point by clicking the ‘Export to Excel’ button that is located at the bottom left corner of the ‘Direct Debit Renewals’ screen. That is as long as your IT Team have installed Excel on your computer. Clicking this button should open the results in Excel. If there are any issues ask your IT team to investigate, as MS Excel has its own security (‘Trust Center’) settings that can prevent third part application like MStore from opening MS Excel. If there are still issues then you or they can log a ticket with K3’s Support team to investigate further. Click the Excel iconon your computer’s 'Taskbar' to view this export. If required you can then save these results as an Excel file in the usual way to the required location, this allows you’re your organisation to save a record of what is being renewed by this process. This is the easiest way to retain an audit trail of which direct debit memberships have been renewed by this process. To renew these listed direct debit members in MStore now click the ‘Renew All Listed DDs’ button. You will then see the following screen, to proceed with the renewals click ‘Yes’ if you want to renew the members. Alternatively, if you are unsure and want to make any checks at this point click ‘No’ or ‘Cancel’. For example you may have forgotten to do the export to Excel, so you could click ‘No’ and run the export. For all the members listed (if required) you can now generate their direct debit renewal letter using the Word’s mail merge functionality in MS Word. This will require your IT team to have installed MS Word on your computer. To use this functionality you will have already need to have had training on and know how to set up MS Word mail merge templates using MStore. Please note this content us covered in a separate user guide. Click the button where shown and the Windows ‘File Explorer’ screen will appear. Navigate to and select the require mail merge template documents you have already set up (see above *). Click on the required MS mail merge template document and then click the ‘Open’ button. 1. The selected MS mail merge template document will now appear where shown. 2. On clicking the ‘Print Letters using Microsoft Word’ the following pop-up message appears. If Microsoft Word was not already open the ‘Word’ icon will now be showing on your task bar. Please note as with the ‘Export to Excel’ functionality, MS Word has its own security (‘Trust Center’) settings that can prevent third part application like MStore from opening MS Word. If MS Word does not open or errors at this point please get your own IT to check the relevant Microsoft security settings. If there are still issues then you or they can log a ticket with K3’s Support team to investigate further to see if they can assist but please note K3 do not (i) provide support or (ii) training on using Microsoft Word itself, including how to use it mail merge functionality. For some versions of Word it has been noted that unless you first minimise then maximise the Word application then you are not able to access all the mail merge functionality withing MS Word and that is out of K3’s control. If when MS Word opens nothing happens when you click mail merge specific functionality in MS Word, then please minimise then maximise the Word application. Carry out the mail merge in MS Word and save any Word documents as required. Save any documents before exiting the MS Word application. Please note if you decide not to proceed with carrying out any mail merge in Word and try and close the MStore ‘Direct Debit Renewals’ screen without carrying out a mail merge in Word, you will get a pop up warning and reminder in MStore. Clicking ‘Cancel’ will return the MStore ‘Direct Debit Renewals’. So if required you could still follow the process and carry out a mail merge using MS Word. Clicking ‘Ok’ will close the MStore ‘Direct Debit Renewals’ screen. All the direct debit members that were listed in the MStore ‘Direct Debit Renewals’ screen. are now renewed and the process to generate the required submission files and will continue as normal. If you first selected a specific direct debit scheme (as opposed to the ‘Renew All Schemes’ ) then (if you have more than one direct debit scheme) then you may need to repeat the above process as explained above for each ‘Direct Debit Scheme’. As discussed previously the above direct debit renewal process is often typically carried out several weeks in advance of expiry depending on your organizations' requirements. The reason for this is to enable you to have time to process each member’s response to sending out your direct debit renewal letters prior to the next submission being generated using MStore. For each member who responds confirming they do not want to continue to pay for their membership via direct debit, this allows adequate time for you to cancel any member(s) direct debit authorisation in MStore prior to the next submission. This process must be done to stop further direct debit payments being taken. To see how to cancel a member’s direct debit authorisation in MStore is covered in a previous section entitled 'Dealing with Members no Longer Paying by Direct Debit'. Alternatively, for members that wish to continue to pay for their membership via direct debit, then no further action is required. Their details will continue to be submitted by the direct debit submissions files processes as detailed in the earlier sections on creating / processing direct debit submission files. Please Note: The direct debit renewals process will automatically renew the memberships of all relevant members and it will update their expiry date to the new one. The new direct debit payments will automatically be created in each of the direct debit memberships renewed by this process (under a new ‘Auth Number’). This can be seen if you find and open a direct debit member record that has been renewed by clicking the ‘Direct Debit’ tab. By default you will be seeing direct debit payments for the current ‘Auth Number’. But you can click on the dropdown selector and select the required ‘Auth Number’ to the historic information. This is useful to know for auditing and troubleshooting purposes. N.B. the first payment direct debit payments history will show under ‘Auth Number’ 1, then when they are renewed the next lot of direct debt payments that are expected will show under ‘Auth Number’ 2. This number will increase by 1 each time their direct debit memberships are renewed.",
