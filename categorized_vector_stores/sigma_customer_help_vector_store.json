    "text": "General Ledger Year-End Processing The following section explains how you can complete your accounting for the end of the financial year and move on to the next. You need to undertake the following activities: - Complete transaction processing and report production for the final period of the year. This normally finalises the current year actuals for the year, and gives you your year-end Profit and Loss statements, Balance sheet, and any other financial statements you require. However, you can make retrospective adjustments after moving into the new accounting year, if necessary. If appropriate, clear down the balance in your current account(s) to zero, by posting your dividend or retained earnings accounts. If you have set up the current accounts as closed accounts, you will need to open the accounts to do this and then close them again afterwards (see Account Codes). Review the control parameters that specify your original budget, first revision budget, second revision budget and next year budget year end processing rules (see Ledger Control Parameters). Review the control parameters that specify whether the original budget, first revision budget or second revision budget values are to be retained at year end as last year's budgets (see Ledger Control Parameters). Follow the procedure described in Start New Period to set up the calendar for the new financial year and complete the Start New Period for period 1 of the new year. The system updates the files as follows: Current year period balances become last year period actuals. Any one of the original, first revision and second revision budget period values may be used as last year budgets for the new year. The budgets are then either cleared or left intact, according to the control parameter rules (see Ledger Control Parameters). The next year budget period values may be used as the original, first revision or second revision budgets for the new year. After copying, they are either cleared or left intact, according to the control parameter rules (see Ledger Control Parameters). The transactions for all accounts are removed from the transaction files, unless you have set the Retain Transactions Default parameter in the ledger's control parameters to Indefinite. You should note that any transactions that were created prior to the setting of the Retain Transactions Default parameter to this value are also removed. The setting of this flag does not affect transactions that are already on file.",
