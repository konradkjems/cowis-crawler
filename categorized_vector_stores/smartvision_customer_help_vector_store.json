    "title": "SmartVision Costing Method",
    "text": "Costing Method: The Cost Per Unit for parts depends upon the Costing Method defined here. The three possible costing methods are: S = Standard costing A = Average costing P = Last purchase If the costing method is set to \"S\" (standard), the part cost comes from manual maintenance of Maintain Cost Data or as calculated by Recalculate Cost Rollups. Average costing is only used for Purchase Parts (B, D, Y). When receiving against a PO, if the costing method is average, then a new average cost is calculated as each purchase order is received. The Average Cost (AC) is calculated as: (PO Cost * Rec Qty) + (On Hand Qty * Part Master Cost) Rec Qty + On Hand Qty Receipt Quantity is converted from Purchasing units of measure to Cost unit of measure using the Purchase Cost Conversion. The Bill of Materials Unit of Measure is entered in Part Master. The Purchasing Unit is entered in Purchase Part Data. If P (last purchase) is entered as the costing method, each time a receipt is processed against a purchase order in Receipt To Stock, SmartVision writes the purchase order's unit cost to the part's material cost field stored in the part master file. The order's unit cost will replace the current standard cost with the latest purchase cost of the item. If, however, the cost set is not set to 00, but to a cost set 01-08, that cost set is written to instead of the part master file.",

    "title": "Replacing an Existing ID with a New ID",
    "text": "You can use the Find and Replace Utility to: Change the ID of a customer, employee, material, vendor, work center, location, GL account number, bank code, tax name, or sales code anywhere it is used in JobBOSS. Change multiple material IDs at once using a text file. For example, you might need to do this if one of your customers changes the name of its business. If the ID you want to change it to already exists in JobBOSS, see Merging an Existing ID into Another Existing ID instead. What happens when I replace an ID? When you replace an existing ID with a new ID in JobBOSS: The change affects all instances of that ID in the JobBOSS database, including historical items (such as closed jobs and POs). No record of the change exists in JobBOSS. Only the specified ID field changes. Any associated fields remain unchanged. (For example, if you change a Customer ID, the customer's Name remains as-is). If you use an accounting solution other than JobBOSS Accounting, you are responsible for making the corresponding change in your accounting software. Before using the Find and Replace Utility: Verify that the version of the utility matches your JobBOSS version. Using the wrong version of the utility can affect the integrity of your database. Notify all users to log off of JobBOSS. Back up the JobBOSS database that will be affected by the Find and Replace Utility. The Find and Replace Utility does not allow you to undo your changes. If a mistake is made, you can restore the database from the backup file, then make the change as originally intended.",

The program can be found in the SmartVision client bin folder and has the name: K3BTG.SmartVision.Client.OdbcAdministrator.exe Since execution of the program requires administrative privileges, a User Account Control dialog will be displayed upon launching the program: Click the Yes button to allow the SmartVision Client ODBC Administrator program to proceed. If the SmartVision Client ODBC Administrator is unable to confirm the path to the folder that contains the MAX.EXE and/or MAXDSNDP.INI files, a dialog is displayed giving the option to enter a new path. Click the Yes button to allow a different folder to be selected Navigate to the required folder and click the Open button to select the desired path. Note: The path to the folder containing the MAX.EXE file should be defined using UNC format. The SmartVision Client ODBC Administrator will then check all SmartVision Companies defined in the installation and report any errors detected. E.g. If any DSNs are missing, these will be created automatically by the SmartVision Client ODBC Administrator. On a 32-bit machine, only 32-bit DSNs are relevant. On a 64-bit client, 32-bit and 64-bit DSNs will be created if they are found to be missing. Finally, a window will be displayed showing details of the SmartVision Companies detected and the DNSs now present. Click the X button in the top-right corner to close the dialog and exit the program.",
