To view a Linked CSR Document simply click on the CSR Document to view. 2. The CSR Document will pop up in a window for you to view. To close simply click anywhere off the CSR Document. Viji Graph The ViJi Graph uses a 'tree' structure that allows suppliers to track products through the supply chain. Users can see where their products came from and any relevant sustainability or quality information. However, the information is limited to products and suppliers directly connected to the user in the supply chain CSR Commitments This tab shows you the commitments associated with the item along with their status. Linked Sales Orders If you've linked any Sales Orders to your Purchase Order, you can view them by going to the Linked Sales Order Lines tab. It's important to note that you'll need to create the links between the orders for them to appear on this list. For further information on how to Link a Sales Order to a Purchase Order. Archive Purchase Orders As a brand user, you can use the 'Archive' feature to manage your Purchase Orders. Whether a season has concluded or you no longer collaborate with a specific supplier, archiving allows you to organize and streamline your records effectively. There are three status rules based on the user, whether they are a brand or a supplier. These rules are outlined below: As a Brand: The brand can identify which lines are archived, providing essential information for multiple users within the account. As a Supplier: The supplier is informed about which line linked to a Sales Order from the brand's Purchase Order has been archived. A Supplier viewing Sales Orders: The supplier is aware that the line linked to a Sales Order from the brand's Purchase Order is archived, and the linking action is disabled. 1. To start, go to the page where your Purchase Orders are located. 2. Utilize the checkboxes to choose the Purchase Orders you want to archive, and then, using the \"Actions\" button, opt for the \"Archive\" option. 3. You will now see the \"Status\" has changed to Archived. NOTE: You can easily 'Unarchive' Purchase Orders when needed. Just follow steps 1 and 2, and select the 'Unarchive' option from the 'Actions' menu.",

    "text": "Being able to Import your purchase orders allows you to streamline your procurement process and save time and resources. This process is faster and more accurate, as it eliminates the risk of human error that can occur during manual data entry. When you import your Item(s), orders, and suppliers into ViJi, it will be automatically uploaded and the this information into your VijiTrack. Your suppliers will then receive an email to link their purchases with their orders using Viji Track, which starts the creation of your supply chains. Uploading Purchase Orders TABLE OF CONTENTS Download Template Populating the Template Importing the Template Purchase Order Details Purchase Order Line Details Failed Import Download Template To begin importing your Purchase Orders click \"Download Template\". Populating the Template NOTE: Always make sure you are using the latest template. If you are uncertain, use the \"Download Template\" function.

If it is an alias, simply check the box next to the primary supplier associated with the alias and click \"Create Alias\". NOTE: The term \"alias\" is used in this context to refer to a name that is similar to another but represents the same entity. In case the supplier is not an alias, you have the option to click on the \"Create new supplier\" button.

    "text": "TABLE OF CONTENTS AGEC Law (Anti-Gaspillage pour une Économie Circulaire) CSR (Corporate Social Responsibility) CSR Commitments CSR Document Entity ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance) PO (Purchase Order) Item CSR Documents Questionnaire Sales Orders Supplier Here is a non-exhaustive list of acronyms and terms frequently used in the solution and documentation, along with their meanings: AGEC Law (Anti-Gaspillage pour une Économie Circulaire) The AGEC Law, implemented in France in February 2020, aims to promote a circular economy and reduce waste. It introduces measures like extended producer responsibility (EPR), where producers are accountable for their items throughout their lifecycle, including recycling and disposal. The law also establishes a deposit and return system for plastic bottles, improves item labelling on environmental impact, sets waste reduction targets, promotes circular economy contracts, and addresses plastic waste through bans and recycling initiatives. The AGEC Law signifies the French government's comprehensive efforts to transition towards a more sustainable and circular economy by addressing waste and promoting recycling practices. CSR (Corporate Social Responsibility) This term refers to the actions and initiatives that businesses take to positively impact society and address important issues. It goes beyond just making profits and involves considering the well-being of employees, customers, communities, and the environment. CSR can include things like supporting charities, taking care of the environment, treating employees fairly, and contributing to local communities. It's about businesses taking responsibility for their actions and doing good for the world around them. CSR Commitments Referring to promises made by fashion brands and companies to operate in a socially responsible and ethical manner, CSR commitments in the fashion industry encompass various aspects. These include fair labor practices, transparent supply chains, and respect for human rights. Additionally, environmental stewardship is emphasized through actions like reducing carbon emissions, conserving resources, and adopting sustainable practices. Fashion brands also prioritize engaging stakeholders, promoting diversity and employee well-being, and continuously improving their CSR practices. Responsible supply chain management, philanthropy, and community involvement are also part of these commitments. Through these CSR commitments, fashion companies demonstrate their dedication to sustainable and responsible business practices, positively impacting the industry and the world. CSR Document A CSR document serves as a comprehensive declaration of a brand's dedication to social and environmental responsibility in the fashion industry. It covers various aspects such as sustainable materials and production, fair labor policies, transparent supply chains, animal welfare, recycling, circular economy initiatives, and responsible marketing. The document also highlights the brand's specific goals, targets, and performance metrics, showcasing its advancements in areas like carbon emissions reduction, ethical sourcing, community engagement, and diversity and inclusion. By sharing this information, the CSR document enables fashion companies to effectively communicate their responsible practices, engage stakeholders, and promote transparency and accountability throughout the industry. Entity An entity typically refers to a distinct and identifiable object, organization, or being that exists separately from others. In business and legal contexts, an entity commonly denotes a legally recognized and independent organization, such as a company, corporation, partnership, or nonprofit organization. These entities have their legal existence and are separate from their owners, carrying rights, obligations, and responsibilities. They can engage in contracts, conduct business operations, own assets, and be held accountable for their actions. Entities are often established to pursue specific goals, whether for-profit or non-profit, and they play a vital role in shaping the structure and operations of the business and legal realms. ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance) This is a framework used to assess how well a company performs in three important areas. Environmental: This refers to a company's impact on the environment and how it manages environmental risks. It includes factors such as resource usage, waste management, pollution control, and efforts to combat climate change. Social: This focuses on a company's relationships with people and society. It involves evaluating how a company treats its employees, engages with communities, promotes diversity and inclusion, ensures human rights, and supports social causes. Governance: This relates to a company's internal systems and processes that guide its operations. It encompasses things like the composition of the board of directors, executive compensation, transparency in financial reporting, and ethical decision-making. PO (Purchase Order) A purchase order (PO) is a commercial document that a buyer issues to a seller to express their intention to purchase goods or services. It acts as a formal contract between the two parties, specifying important transaction details like quantity, description, price, delivery terms, and other relevant conditions. The purpose of a PO is to establish clarity and agreement between the buyer and seller, enabling smooth order processing, inventory management, and payment reconciliation. It serves as a reference document for both parties during the procurement process. Item CSR Documents In the fashion industry, a Item CSR (Corporate Social Responsibility) document focuses on the social and environmental impact of a specific fashion item or line. It provides comprehensive information about the item's lifecycle, covering material sourcing, manufacturing, distribution, use, and end-of-life considerations. The document emphasizes sustainable material choices, ethical manufacturing processes, transparent supply chain practices, and environmental impacts like carbon footprint and waste generation. It also highlights any certifications, eco-labels, or industry standards the item meets, demonstrating its compliance with recognized sustainability benchmarks. By presenting this information, the Item CSR document allows fashion brands to effectively communicate the sustainable features and benefits of their items, empowering consumers to make informed choices based on social and environmental considerations. Questionnaire These are forms that you or a supplier can create and allocate within the solution to collect pertinent CSR (Corporate Social Responsibility) information. Sales Orders A sales order is a document a seller creates in response to a customer's request to purchase goods or services. It serves as an official record of the transaction and provides details such as requested items or services, quantities, prices, payment terms, delivery information, and other relevant conditions. The sales order is used by the seller to process the order, fulfil customer requirements, allocate inventory, generate an invoice, and initiate item or service delivery. It ensures a smooth sales process, and accurate order fulfillment, and serves as a reference for both the seller and the customer throughout the transaction. Supplier A supplier is an entity or individual that provides goods, materials, or services to another organization or individual. In the business context, suppliers, typically companies or vendors, play a crucial role in the supply chain. They offer raw materials, components, equipment, or finished goods to manufacturers, retailers, or service providers. Additionally, they may provide specialized services like logistics, distribution, or technical support. Suppliers are essential in the procurement process as they ensure the availability and quality of inputs required for smooth business operations. Building strong relationships with reliable suppliers is vital for maintaining a consistent supply, meeting customer demands, and achieving overall business success.",

    "title": "FAQ",
    "text": "Writing your first FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) can be a great way to provide valuable information to your audience and address common queries they may have. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you get started: 1. Identify your target audience: Determine who your audience is and what questions they are likely to have. Understand their needs, concerns, and the information they may be seeking. 2. Brainstorm common questions: Start by brainstorming a list of questions that are frequently asked or anticipated by your audience. These questions should cover a broad range of topics related to your product, service, or organization. 3. Categorize questions: Once you have a list of questions, group them into categories or sections. This will help your readers navigate through the FAQ more easily and find the information they are looking for quickly. 4. Craft clear and concise answers: Write clear, straightforward answers to each question. Keep your responses concise and to the point, but make sure they provide enough information to address the query effectively. Use simple language and avoid jargon or technical terms that may confuse your readers. 5. Use a consistent format: Maintain a consistent format throughout your FAQ document. You can use a question-and-answer format, with the questions in bold or as headers followed by their respective answers. This helps readers quickly locate the information they need. 6. Anticipate additional questions: While drafting your answers, consider if there are any follow-up questions that may arise based on your responses. Include those anticipated follow-up questions and provide comprehensive answers to them as well. 7. Keep it updated: FAQs should be dynamic and reflect the evolving needs of your audience. Regularly review and update your FAQ to include new questions or address any changes in your product or service. 8. Add supplementary information: In addition to answering common questions, consider including supplementary information that may be helpful to your readers. This could include links to relevant resources, troubleshooting guides, or additional tips and recommendations. 9. Test and gather feedback: Share your FAQ with a small group of individuals or customers to gather feedback. Ask for their input on the clarity and usefulness of the content. Use this feedback to make improvements and refine your FAQ. 10. Make it easily accessible: Publish your FAQ on your website or platform where your audience can easily access it. Consider adding a search bar or an index to allow users to find specific questions quickly. Remember, an effective FAQ should provide value to your audience by addressing their concerns and helping them find the information they need. Continuously monitor and update your FAQ based on the feedback and evolving needs of your audience to ensure it remains a helpful resource.",
