    "text": "This feature enables Google and Apple Wallet pages to be used with our e-commerce ticketing. Websites will need to undergo enhancements to have this feature added. It can be applied to V1 and V1.5 Websites. One it has been added there will be two options within the website admin config. Each of the options will allow the customer to change the pictures that are passed to the wallets data. We would expect customers to change the descriptions but not the values pulled from our system. We have created the options to make it easier and more Customisable as customers require changes. For a customer to start receiving these passes as part of the email they receive. The emails can be modified to with two new merge fields. If they do not want the passes to be available on certain types of bookings. This can be done by not including them in the email template the customer receives. We have written an API to allow the passing of this information for all our customers to a single point and using our certificates. With this in place, the customer configuration involvement is minimal. Examples: Booking reference along the top as normal. If the customer uses unique tickets and the merge tag is on the email and this feature is turned on with the merge tag on the email. It will show a a digital wallet option for the individual ticket. This allow entry or validation on a per ticket basis. The code being sent is the unique ticket reference. There is an option at the bottom to add a digital wallet for the whole booking. The QR Code that is associated with the pass will be the booking reference. If using unique tickets the pass shows the ticket info and individual quantity. The total quantity is shown which in this case indicates 1/2 tickets. If using the booking reference, there will be no ticket information, no quantity. The total Qty is shown for the number of booked items. The code is the booking reference. Key important information in this summary view is the date, template description, the total quantity, the time and the booking reference. The time is that of when they are intending to arrive or if they use general timeslots for all day. It is suggested \"Time\" be changed to \"Opening Time\" or similar in the options listed above. Digital Wallets for Memberships: Configuration for memberships is separate to bookings. The descriptions can be modified, for example some of our customers would prefer annual pass type or holder name etc. The email template will need to use the merge tag: It is a standard tag to show details of each membership on screen separately. If the tag is present and the site is using digital wallets the attachments for memberships (apple) or the google wallet option will appear. Key points to note: 1) In my screenshots above it only shows Google Wallet, that is because the screens were taken on an android device. If on an apple device it apple pass attachments as part of the email they receive. 2) This is not intended to show price, be a receipt or be a breakdown of an itinerary. It is PASS. 3) Digital Wallets for memberships extend current functionality and doesn't change it. Temporary card numbers, real card numbers will depend on their onsite configurations. This just extends the card numbers will have already received to their digital wallets. Finer points of card numbers is outside the scope of this work and is just standard setup advice.",

The application will use the same SQL procedures as the windows application and the way the device works will be identical. The screens will look a little different as they are android and not windows but the functions on screen and the way they work will remain the same. Knowing how to use the original device or following previous instructions will be enough. There are some nice little changes within the app. They are noted below. App icons using the K3 Logo. Login screen: Information tiles along the top to inform the user of the date/time and activity and status of the device. The ability to not show functions/activities that aren't going to be used by users. By unticking them, the choices will no longer appear on the main menu. I have chose to see only two in the list below. On the main screen there are now only two choices. The options to use external scanner is possible. It might be the device uses an internal or external scanner and won't be needing the camera to scan barcodes. By ticking this box. it will disable the camera screen from showing and auto focus on barcode box ready to accept what is being scanned by the scanner. Diagnostics menu is useful. It will show the version. When supporting the device it is important to know the version. It allows for testing connection to it's local database on the phone, the remote database it connects to and allows for showing logs. Logs will appear on screen. The app will log everything it does. It will show the SQL each time to make errors easier to diagnose. The user can then share them using the normal apps on the phone. As of version 1.2.2 onwards there is an archive function. It can be accessed via the diagnostics option on the main screen. Details look like: Restore will be grayed out if the device is current mid activity/function By clicking restore and confirming, the data will be back on the device as it was prior to upload. The contents can be seen, the data can be edited and resubmitted. This does not delete any of the previous submissions. Anything restored will be removed the achieve and be placed back with new information such as upload times etc. A useful tool for allowing users to reupload data alongside support deleting the data from the server if needed as part of a support issue. 06-01-2025- Feature enhancement - Version 1.3.0 A new feature has been added to allow replacing stock using the check stock function. A new button has been added to the bottom once an item has been scanned. Allowing replacing the stock quantities on items and updating them. This will add a zeroise prior and add the new quantity for the chosen location/s. This is the same as when performed from the back office. This feature can only be used online. It does not place data in to an inspection holding area. Changes made will be be done immediately and can be seen from within the stock audit as normal. This concludes the tweaks to the MTab application for stocking in MStore.",
