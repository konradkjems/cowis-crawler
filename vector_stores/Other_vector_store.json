Impact Urgency Environment/Hardware Details Customer's Own Reference Number Product Name Product - Version Requestor's name How to Create a Ticket A ticket can be created by emailing support@k3btg.com as well as phoning for emergencies (see What is the phone number for Support?) To start the process of creating a ticket on the portal, simply click the Submit a Ticket button on the top right of the menu. This is the best option as explained in You're here, but why use the portal? Information Required to Create a Ticket Below is an explanation of each field you see on the portal. Not all fields are necessary, but the mandatory ones are marked with a red asterisk. . Remember, the more you help us by providing lots of information, the more we can help you. Requester The requestor is automatically populated with your email address. Please do not change this. You can add other people to be notified/copied on the ticket, but they must be a registered contact in our system (otherwise the email address is ignored/removed) Subject Subject should be a short meaningful summary of the request. Site Name Select from the list of sites/stores which we have on record for your company. If the location is not listed, then please select the last option \"zz Not Listed...\" and include the site name in the ticket Description box so that we can add that site, and update the ticket. When you submit your first ticket from the portal, the Site you use is set as your default. This means that each time you submit a ticket after this, your default Site will be automatically selected, but you can change the Site for that ticket by selecting from the dropdown list. Description of Request If the request is an Incident (something's not working as expected), please include a description of what the issue is with screenshots if applicable, upload any files, is it replicable (does it always happen, or just sometimes), and how this is impacting you/the company. If your request is for us to help you with something, deliver something, or a feature/configuration request, please provide as much information as you can. Ticket Category This is very important so we understand if you have a problem which needs fixing, or if you need help, or want something else from us. The Service Level Agreement (SLA) only Incidents which are K3's responsibility (K3 software or hardware fault if you have a contract for us to provide support), but we will do our best to respond to the other types within similar timescales as well. Incident Select this category if something's not working as expected. This might be a suspected software bug/fault, or hardware fault etc, but this can be defined in the Sub-category dropdown list. Service Request Select this category if you want us to help you with something or deliver something to you Change Request Select this category if you would like us to consider a change to our software (otherwise known as a Feature Request), or change your configuration (might be chargeable). Sub-Category The list of sub-categories will change depending on what Ticket Category you have selected. This helps us to understand the type of request and route/prioritise it correctly. Impact and Urgency What Are They and Why? The Impact and urgency are described below. They are used to calculate the priority of a ticket. Details on this can be seen in How quickly can I expect my ticket to be dealt with? Please do not be tempted to assign all tickets a High Impact (for Incidents only) and High Urgency unless you have a whole site unable to trade. Impact This dropdown list is only shown if the Ticket Category is \"Incident\" because an impact is only really felt when something doesn't work as expected. Urgency Urgency reflects how quickly this needs to be investigated/delivered. Environment/Hardware Details If your request pertains to hardware or the IIT environment/infrastructure which the hardware is in, please provide us details here to keep this information separate and clear for everyone. Customer's Own Reference Number If you have an IT system where you have logged an issue or request before logging it with us, you might want to put your IT system reference number in here to help you match them up. Product Name This is to tell us the name of the software, or perhaps \"Other\" if you have purchased something other than software from us (e.g. hardware only or hardware support). if you have only purchased one product from us , the Product Name will be pre-populated with that product. If you have purchased more than one, you will need to select which one from the dropdown list Product - Version If you know the version of the product (for non-cloud software only because cloud software is always on the latest version which we install), and it's relevant to the ticket, please let us know to speed up our investigation. Requestor's name If you are using your own email address to login to the portal, you do not need to enter anything here. If you are using a store/site generic email (or a manager's email, or any email address which is not just fir you), type your name in here so that you and us know who raised the ticket to avoid confusion if someone else reads the email etc",

    "text": "TABLE OF CONTENTS Feedback on Resolved Tickets I Clicked the Wrong Rating - How Can I Correct It? What Do K3 Do With the Feedback? Feedback on Knowledge Base articles There are two ways in which you can communicate directly to the Support team to help us improve, or tell us when we've done well :-) Feedback on Resolved Tickets When certain types of tickets are resolved, the email notifying you will ask you to complete a very quick satisfaction survey - just a few clicks unless you want to add a comment as well (which is very useful if you choose one of the \"Extremely\" ratings). Once you click on one of the above, you will be taken to a screen which looks like the below. As you hover your mouse over the dots under the extra two questions, you will see the possible ratings change (same options as for the main question). What Do K3 Do With the Feedback? The Support team have Customer Satisfaction (CSAT) targets which are personal and for the whole team. The whole K3 team have access to reports to review the CSAT ratings and trends so that they can react to them. Managers are automatically emailed if there are any \"Extremely Unsatisfied\" ratings, and regularly review any comments added by customers. Comments really help us take action in response to ratings, whether it be issues, or praising staff or teams for their excellent customer service. I Clicked the Wrong Rating - How Can I Correct It? If you click the wrong rating by mistake, and what to correct it after you've submitted it, just go into the ticket on the portal (you might need to set the filter on the right of the Tickets page to show your resolved tickets) You will see an option to \"Rate us again\" which will open the original ticket rating screen for you to select your choices again. Feedback on Knowledge Base articles Every knowledgebase article has the following at the bottom of it: If you click \"Yes\", then we will know that this is an article which is useful, so we will make sure that it is updated when necessary so it's kept in place for you and other customers in future. If you click \"No\", you will be shown the below so you can tell us what needs improving in the article (or maybe another article needs to be written by us)",

Outdated Software Version ✅ How to restore full support Need help? Why your support is limited and what to do next Most ticket statuses should be self-explanatory, but if your ticket is set to \"Support On Stop\", what does it mean? To ensure we deliver fast, effective support for all customers, we operate a Support on Stop policy in specific (rare!) circumstances. This article explains what it means, the reasons it may be applied, and how to restore full support. What is “Support on Stop”? If your organisation is placed into Support on Stop, it means that some, or all tickets will be placed on hold until the issue is resolved. This means that the SLA timer will be paused. You’ll be notified via the Support Portal if your ticket is affected. ⚠️ Why might support be on stop? There are two main reasons your organisation may be placed into Support on Stop: 1. Commercial Hold (Unpaid Invoices or Contract Issues) If there are outstanding payments, expired agreements, or other commercial concerns relating to your contract, your organisation may also be placed into Support on Stop. K3's Finance team determine when a customer are put on hold for this reason, and when they are taken off hold. 2. Outdated Software Version For some on-premise (non-cloud) products, e.g. MStore, if the version you have is more than 12 months old, you will be placed on Support on Stop until your system is upgraded to a supported version. Priority 1 and 2 faults, and non-software related requests are still dealt with as normal Staying up to date ensures access to new features, improved stability, and quicker issue resolution. To schedule an upgrade, please raise a request via the Support Portal: Service Request → Software Delivery Request For MStore, you can see more in What versions of MStore are supported? ✅ How to restore full support To resume full support, the underlying reason for the hold must be resolved: For commercial holds: Settle outstanding invoices or resolve contract issues with your Customer Success Manager. For software version holds: Upgrade to a supported version of MStore. Once resolved, support for all ticket types will be reinstated. Need help? If you're unsure why your support has been limited, or you’d like help getting back on track, please contact your Customer Success Manager.",

    "text": "We have reflected on the past year as well as looking forward to the new one. We have reviewed the customer satisfaction feedback many of you have provided (requested by email when we resolved tickets), and looked at our support system statistics after its first full calendar year in operation. Here are our key achievements and what we are going to change in response to your feedback which includes faster resolution targets and more phone access to the Support team. For MStore customers, there's more good news in MStore Support Update January 2025. Fast Resolution During 2024, we resolved Incidents (faults/issues) 79% faster on average than the Service Level Agreement (SLA) targets. The full results can be seen on UK Support Stats for 2024. We have therefore decided to: Upgrade (free of charge) the Incident Resolution SLA We will aim to provide an even faster service as shown below. Phone Calls To and From Support We’ve had feedback that some customers feel that Support do not use the phone as a channel to help customers. During 2024 we: Answered 1,347 phone calls which lasted 9 minutes, 31 seconds on average for new issues being raised. Made 3,306 calls out to customers, lasting an average 6 minutes, 2 seconds. If we feel that the best way of resolving a ticket is by talking to you, we will! During the year we have consistently requested that customers to only phone us for situations where a location is unable to trade (i.e. a Priority 1 fault). This keeps the phone lines free for such emergencies for all of our customers. We have also integrated our support system with Microsoft Teams during the last year, which also means that any P1s raised directly by you via the portal are instantly messaged to the entire UK support team, so the portal is now just as fast as the phone and can enable you to provide better quality information about your issue (e.g. screenshots, error messages, etc), and reaches a wider Support audience immediately. Based on your feedback we have decided to now accept phones calls to Support for both P1 and P2 issues for customers on the Standard SLA agreement, and P1, P2 and P3 issues for customers with a Premium SLA agreement. We are adding more people to the phone lines to manage this, but the choice is now yours – the portal may still be better to send us detailed information, and see what may be already available to help you within the knowledge base articles. We hope that these improvements will help you in your daily use of our systems and services, and encourage you to provide feedback on support tickets as often as you can to help us to continue to make further improvements in how we support you in 2025 and beyond. Note that Extended Hours support remains for P1s for (contracted customers) only",

    "text": "In addition to the UK Customer Support Update 2025, MStore customers also have the following updates: Free Annual Upgrade The software for upgrades is always provided free of charge (to customers paying for support and maintenance). Historically, we have not charged the time and effort to implement upgrades if the upgrade is to fix a fault, and if the upgrade is undertaken in normal business hours. For 2025 we are introducing that every customer can have the one free of charge upgrade per year (during normal business hours). This will enable you to take advantage of all the latest features that have been developed and will keep your system up to date. Upgrades during normal hours to fix significant faults will continue to remain free of charge. IF your current version of MStore is more than 12 months old, we would encourage you to request an upgrade because older versions cannot be supported to the same level as current versions. A full explanation can be found in What versions of MStore are supported? User Guides Updated and Searchable! We have been working hard to update our user guides, as well as provide regular recorded Webinars to help our customers get the best out of the extensive feature-set which MStore provides. In February, we will be replacing the current k3btg.training website with full product user guides maintained by the product development team in the Freshdesk support system This means that you’ll be able to search the guides for information and, when raising a support ticket, the AI in our Support system will search the guides for you to find potential resolutions or answers to your questions – all in one place. We hope that these improvements will help you in your daily use of MStore and encourage you to provide feedback on support tickets as often as you can to help us to continue to make further improvements in how we service and support you in 2025 and beyond.",

Full Service Level Agreements Ticket Type We will take into account the type of request, the urgency, and the impact (if it's a fault). We prioritise Incidents (which means something's not working as expected) over other requests for how-to do something or changes you'd like. Impact and Urgency Once the Impact and Urgency has been determined (note that only Urgency is required for non-incidents), the priority is calculated. Note that High Impact and High Urgency (which calculates to a Priority 1 Incident) are reserved for the rare situations when trading is not possible at a whole site (which may be a shop. café, website). The impact and urgency may change over time, and the K3 Support team may change the Impact and Urgency according to their evaluation. Priority Assigned Once the ticket has been registered, the Priority will be calculated and made visible on the list of tickets you can see on the portal. Note that the highest priority which a Service Request or Change Request can be assigned is a P3. Target Times The times below are targets (not a guarantee), but we try to meet these times where possible, and beat the targets in the majority of cases. Note that a Recovery is where we provide a workaround while a permanent solution is being worked on. Note that the SLA timer will be paused when we are waiting for the customer to provide more information, and outside of business hours. When Will We Work On Your Ticket? We work on tickets of all priorities during normal business hours, and if out of hours extended support has been purchased, we will work on P1 (and P2 for Premium SLA customers) during extended hours as well - see What days and times is Support available? We work on tickets according to their priority and target dates as shown above.

    "text": "K3 Standard Service Level Agreement (SLA) TABLE OF CONTENTS Introduction Support Organisation Overview Ticket Priorities and Definitions Ticket Classification Impact and Urgency Priority SLA Target Times Support Service Hours Standard Hours Extended Hours Accessing Support Services Support Portal Support Hotline Support Email Ticket Communication Escalation Process Definitions and Terms Introduction This Service Level Agreement (SLA) provides additional information and guidance on the K3 Support Service. This Standard SLA aims to help customers understand what to expect from K3’s Support Services, how to get the best out of the service, and the options available to provide the level of cover you require. A Premium SLA is also available - details can be provided on request and found on the Support Portal. This guidance is only relevant for Customers who have a current license or right to use the applicable K3 products, and who have a current applicable Support Service included as part of their agreement. Support Organisation Overview K3’s Service Desk provides Support Services which K3 delivers from multiple locations using global industry standard ITIL® best practices. The Support Team management is ITIL® qualified and reports to the Director of Global Operations. At any one time, there is always one Support Manager responsible for managing major incidents, and dealing with any customer escalations. Support Team members have goals to achieve which include exceeding the targets set out in this document, and also provide high levels of customer satisfaction which is measured from customer feedback upon resolution. Tickets are responded to by K3’s Customer Support Team who will investigate and resolve Incidents, involving more than one person within the Customer Support Team if necessary. If a deeper level of technical expertise is required, Incidents will be escalated to the appropriate K3 team (e.g. software development or hardware team) and worked on as required to seek to bring about a timely resolution where an Incident is confirmed. Ticket Priorities and Definitions Ticket Classification A ticket is classified into three possible categories: Incident Something is not working as expected Service Request You need help or want us to deliver something Change Request You would like us to change configuration or the product This ensures that K3 and customers understand why a ticket’s been raised, and helps prioritise how they are dealt with. Impact and Urgency Tickets are assigned an Impact and Urgency which is used to calculate the priority. Impact is a measure of the effect of an Incident. Urgency is a measure of how long it will be until an Incident has a significant business impact. The definitions of levels of Impact and Urgency are in the table below: Rating Impact Urgency Low Superficial and does not materially impact functionality. A solution can be scheduled for when is mutually convenient. Medium Impacts functionality, but continued system use is possible. Needs to be addressed soon to prevent any further deterioration. High Affects the majority of users and/or prevents use of an entire system. Requires immediate attention. Priority The following table defines the priority levels applied to all tickets which is calculated from the Impact and Urgency. Tickets which are not Incidents (examples include an enquiry on how to do something, or an enhancement request) will be assigned a Priority according to their Urgency only i.e. a Priority of P3, P4, or P5 for Urgency of High, Medium, or Low respectively. The priority of an Incident may change throughout its duration. For example, a Priority 2 Incident may be upgraded to Priority 1 if an Incident affecting some users spreads to all users; or a Priority 1 Incident could be downgraded to Priority 2 if a Workaround is provided in advance of a permanent fix. Urgency Impact Low Medium High Low P5 P4 P3 Medium P4 P3 P2 High P3 P2 P1 The circumstances of an Incident determine its Impact or Urgency. An example is where a store has four Point of Sale (POS) solutions, and one develops a fault which renders it inoperable (hardware or software): During a quiet period when customer numbers are low, this might have an Impact of “Medium” and an Urgency of “Medium” (resulting in a Priority of “P3”). If the same Incident were to occur in a very busy period, the Impact would still be “Medium” (because other POS solutions are operable), but the Urgency may be “High” (resulting in a Priority of “P2”). In the extremely unlikely event that all POS solutions were inoperable in a location, this would be a High Impact and High Urgency Incident, resulting in a Priority of “P1”. Note that a “location” does not necessarily mean everything at a site/store – please see examples below: A P1 could be for a significant area such as a café is not able to trade, even if the shop in another building at the same site is able to trade. If online trading which K3 hosts is not functioning, but trading in a physical store is working, then the website is still a location that cannot trade i.e. a P1 situation. SLA Target Times The table below provides the Target Response and Target Resolution Times for Incidents which are calculated during Business Days. If K3 requires the Customer to provide further information or assistance in relation to an Incident, then the Target Resolution Time in the table below will be extended by the amount of time taken by the Customer to provide the information or assistance. Priority Target First Response Time Target Recovery Time Target Resolution Time P1 1 Hour 1 Business Day 1.5 Business Days P2 4 Hours 3 Business Days 7 Business Days P3 8 Hours 10 Business Days 2 Months P4 18 Hours 1 Month 4 Months P5 36 Hours Not Applicable 6 Months If applicable, the Support Team will endeavour to provide a Workaround which K3 may deem as a sufficient resolution that a permanent fix is not required. Note that the Target Recovery Time and the Target Resolution Time shall not apply to any Incident which is determined not to be a Product Fault, and K3 reserves the right to charge the Customer for any time spent by K3’s Support Team investigating any non-Product Faults (e.g. faults caused by the Customer or Customer’s infrastructure). The service levels listed above are targets only, and do not constitute a guaranteed service level. Any failure by K3 to meet these targets shall not, of itself, constitute a breach of contract or a default on the part of K3. Support Service Hours Standard Hours Standard Hours are weekdays, excluding Public Holidays in the Customer’s country, during the local hours of the K3 Service Desk as displayed on the k3btg.com Support web page (together defined as “Business Days”). Incidents will be worked on during Business Days and additionally, Customers may log Tickets 24x7 by emailing K3 Support or using the K3 Support Portal. Extended Hours Three Extended Hours options are available for additional fees for K3 to provide support for Priority 1 Incidents only as follows (either one or multiple options may be purchased): Weekday Evenings (excl. Public holidays) Saturdays Sundays and Public Holidays (excludes 25th December when we are closed) The hours included in each option vary by country as defined on the k3btg.com Support web page. Any purchased option will be deemed part of a “Business Day” (for the purposes of the Service Desk provision) for Priority 1 Incidents only. * Extended Hours options are not available for some legacy products. Accessing Support Services All Tickets must be investigated through the Customer’s internal support tiers prior to being referred to K3. This is to avoid raising issues with K3 which are not related to K3’s software and services which will delay resolution of the issue for the reporting user. Support Portal The Support Portal website address is https://support.k3btg.com. It is the best choice for Customers to access Support Services because it provides information which may solve the query automatically, and if not, it enables the Support Team to respond and help Customers more quickly due to the structured information about the Ticket which is captured via the Support Portal. In the unlikely event that a whole site is unable to trade (i.e. a Priority 1 Incident), then Customers can either phone the hotline, or raise a Ticket on the Support Portal. Any P1s raised by the portal are automatically notified to all support team members via an integration with K3’s internal chat platform (Microsoft Teams) , so this method is just as fast as making a phone call, and may be the better method if you need to pass lots of information that is difficult to do over the phone (e.g. screenshots). Creating a Ticket via the Support Portal also facilitates efficient follow-up communications such as Support providing updates, and Customers providing further information if requested. Customers can self-register for the portal, and once we have performed verification checks, they will be able to see and do more than via email or phone (see You're here, but why use the portal?), and upon request, customers can see all tickets for their company as well as just their own. Support Hotline For Priority 1 and Priority 2 Incidents, Customers may call the applicable local Support Hotline during Standard Hours (Priority 1 only during Extended Hours, if purchased). Lower priority Incidents, and non-Incidents (requests for help, change requests) must be registered via the Support Portal or email, not via the Hotline. Support may phone the Customer at a later point to explain something or discuss an issue if it’s likely to be the most efficient way to resolve an Incident. Type Contact Danish & Swedish Support Hotline +45 7011 9100 Dutch Support Hotline +31 157 99 78 00 English Support Hotline (except for the below) +44 161 524 6793 English Support Hotline for SmartVision, Omnis, Sigma, JobBOSS +44 190 493 5732 German Support Hotline +49 7344 166 3100 Norwegian Support Hotline +47 3399 8150 Support Email The K3 Support email address is support@k3btg.com. Tickets raised by email default to a category of Service Request, and Priority 4, but once reviewed by a Support Team member, the Category, Impact, and Urgency will be updated in accordance with our understanding of the email content. Unlike tickets raised on the Support Portal which can be automatically prioritised and managed as applicable, this cannot happen automatically with tickets from email until they have been reviewed. Therefore, High Impact and Urgency Incidents should never be reported this way to avoid delays in the Incident being investigated. Ticket Communication Every Ticket raised will be assigned a unique reference number which is provided to the Customer on the Support Portal and via email to enable the Customer and K3 Support to follow up on Tickets efficiently where necessary. If the first contact from a Customer for a Priority 1 or Priority 2 Incident is via calling the Support Hotline, Support will register the details on the Support Portal to track details, notify the Customer of updates, and to maintain a full report of all Tickets raised by each Customer. Ticket updates, status, and target dates are available to view on the portal, and most updates are also emailed to the Customer. The Support Team may phone the Customer if it is determined to be the most efficient and effective way to provide an update or investigate an Incident further. K3’s Support Team will endeavour to communicate in the primary language of the Customer’s country, but to enable the maximum amount of K3’s expertise to be used to solve an Incident, K3’s Support Team may communicate in English even if the first contact was not in English. Escalation Process We are committed to delivering high quality support to all our Customers. In the unlikely event that a Customer has worked through K3’s support processes and is not satisfied with the service received, Customers can escalate the Support Ticket by requesting that a Support Manager is notified or by contacting their K3 Customer Success Manager. Please provide the Ticket number and reason for the escalation. The escalation request will be evaluated by a Support Manager on a number of factors including the Ticket category, and if the Ticket has not met any of the relevant target times in this SLA. Definitions and Terms Please note the following terms and definitions that are used in this document. Term Definition Incident A type of Ticket which is a Product Fault causing an unplanned interruption to the Service or reduction in the quality of the Service. Product Fault Any error, bug, or defect with K3’s software, hardware, or hosting services (excluding any error, bug, or defect contained within any customer specific configuration or infrastructure). Support Services The provision by K3 of a remote support service to enable the Customer to report and K3 to investigate Product Faults in the applicable supported K3 product. Target Recovery Time The time from the Customer successfully registering an Incident with K3 Support to the time that K3 Support provides a Workaround which reduces the impact of an Incident. Target Resolution Time The time from the Customer successfully registering a Ticket with K3 Support to the time that K3 Support provides (i) a Workaround which K3 deems as a sufficient resolution that a permanent fix is not required, (ii) a permanent fix if no Workaround is possible, or if the Workaround cannot remain in place long-term. Target Response Time The time from the Customer successfully registering an Incident with K3 Support to the time that K3 Support first provides a (non-automated) response. Ticket A record of every request made by the Customer to K3 for Support Services. Workaround A temporary solution for an Incident to minimise the business impact while waiting for a permanent fix. As technology, products, and processes evolve, it may be necessary for K3 to amend, update, or supplement this guidance. This document may therefore be amended, updated, or supplemented from time to time by K3, at its discretion.",

    "text": "K3 Premium Service Level Agreement (SLA) TABLE OF CONTENTS Introduction Support Organisation Overview Ticket Priorities and Definitions Ticket Classification Impact and Urgency Priority Support Service Hours Standard Hours Extended Hours Accessing Support Services Support Portal Support Hotline Support Email Ticket Communication Service Management Quarterly Reviews Escalation Process Appendix: Definitions and Terms Introduction This document provides additional information and guidance on the K3 Support Service. This guidance is only relevant for Customers who have purchased the K3 Premium SLA option. For a comparison of the Standard and Premium SLAs, please see What are the differences between the Standard and Premium SLA? Support Organisation Overview K3’s Service Desk provides Support Services which K3 delivers from multiple locations using global industry standard ITIL® best practices. The Support Team management is ITIL® qualified and reports to the Director of Global Operations. At any one time, there is always one Support Manager responsible for managing major incidents, and dealing with any customer escalations. Support Team members have goals to achieve which include exceeding the targets set out in this document, and also provide high levels of customer satisfaction which is measured from customer feedback upon resolution. Tickets are responded to by K3’s Customer Support Team who will investigate and resolve Incidents, involving more than one person within the Customer Support Team if necessary. If a deeper level of technical expertise is required, Incidents will be escalated to the appropriate K3 team (e.g. software development or hardware team) and worked on as required to seek to bring about a timely resolution where an Incident is confirmed. Ticket Priorities and Definitions Ticket Classification A ticket is classified into three possible categories: Incident Something is not working as expected Service Request You need help or want us to deliver something Change Request You would like us to change configuration or the product This ensures that K3 and customers understand why a ticket’s been raised, and helps prioritise how they are dealt with. Impact and Urgency Tickets are assigned an Impact and Urgency which is used to calculate the priority. Impact is a measure of the effect of an Incident. Urgency is a measure of how long it will be until an Incident has a significant business impact. The definitions of Impact and Urgency are in the table below: Rating Impact Urgency Low Superficial and does not materially impact functionality. A solution can be scheduled for when is mutually convenient. Medium Impacts functionality, but continued system use is possible. Needs to be addressed soon to prevent any further deterioration. High Affects the majority of users and/or prevents use of an entire system. Requires immediate attention. Priority The following table defines the priority levels applied to all Tickets which is calculated from the Impact and Urgency. Tickets which are not Incidents (examples include an enquiry on how to do something, or an enhancement request) will be assigned a Priority according to their Urgency only i.e. a Priority of P3, P4, or P5 for Urgency of High, Medium, or Low respectively. The priority of an Incident may change throughout its duration. For example, a Priority 2 Incident may be upgraded to Priority 1 if an Incident affecting some users spreads to all users; or a Priority 1 Incident could be downgraded to Priority 2 if a Workaround is provided in advance of a permanent fix. Urgency Impact Low Medium High Low P5 P4 P3 Medium P4 P3 P2 High P3 P2 P1 The circumstances of an Incident determine its Impact or Urgency. An example is where a store has four Point of Sale (POS) solutions, and one develops a fault which renders it inoperable (hardware or software): During a quiet period when customer numbers are low, this might have an Impact of “Medium” and an Urgency of “Medium” (resulting in a Priority of “P3”). If the same Incident were to occur in a very busy period, the Impact would still be “Medium” (because other POS solutions are operable), but the Urgency may be “High” (resulting in a Priority of “P2”). In the extremely unlikely event that all POS solutions were inoperable in a location, this would be a High Impact and High Urgency Incident, resulting in a Priority of “P1”. Note that a “location” does not necessarily mean everything at a site/store – please see examples below: A P1 could be for a significant area such as a café is not able to trade, even if the shop in another building at the same site is able to trade. If online trading which K3 hosts is not functioning, but trading in a physical store is working, then the website is still a location that cannot trade i.e. a P1 situation. SLA Target Times The table below provides the target times for Incidents and Questions which are calculated during Business Days. The target times are generally twice as fast as the Standard SLA which means that Premium customers will effectively jump the queue compared to Standard SLA customers raising the same priority ticket at a similar time. Priority Target First Response Time Target Recovery Time Target Resolution Time P1 ½ hour 4 Hours 1 Business Day* P2 2 hours 2 Business Days 5 Business Days P3 4 hours 5 Business Days 4 Weeks P4 8 hours 1 Month 2 Months P5 16 hours Not Applicable 4 Months * If a solution is possible remotely; 1.5 business days if an onsite visit is required for a hardware breakdown. If applicable, the Support Team will endeavour to provide a Workaround which K3 may deem as a sufficient resolution that a permanent fix is not required. The scope of what is included in the Premium SLA target times is greater than the Standard SLA; the Standard SLA applies to Incidents only, but this Premium SLA also applies to Questions (How-To) up to a maximum of 15 minutes per ticket (after which training or further support effort will be chargeable). Note that the Target Recovery Time and the Target Resolution Time shall not apply to any Incident which is determined not to be a Product Fault or a Service Request - Question (How-To), and K3 reserves the right to charge the Customer for any time spent by K3’s Support Team investigating any non-product Faults (e.g. faults caused by the Customer or Customer’s infrastructure). The service levels listed above are targets only, and do not constitute a guaranteed service level. Any failure by K3 to meet these targets shall not, of itself, constitute a breach of contract or a default on the part of K3. Support Service Hours Standard Hours Standard Hours are weekdays, excluding Public Holidays in the Customer’s country, during the local hours of the K3 Service Desk as displayed on the k3btg.com Support web page (together defined as “Business Days”). Incidents will be worked on during Business Days and additionally, Customers may log Tickets 24x7 by emailing K3 Support or using the K3 Support Portal. Extended Hours Three Extended Hours options are available for additional fees for K3 to provide support for Priority 1 and 2 Incidents only as follows (either one or multiple options may be purchased): Weekday Evenings (excl. Public holidays) Saturdays Sundays and Public Holidays (excludes 25th December when we are closed) The hours included in each option vary by country as defined on the k3btg.com Support web page. Any purchased option will be deemed part of a “Business Day” (for the purposes of the Service Desk provision) for Priority 1 and 2 Incidents only. * Extended Hours options are not available for some legacy products, and hardware support is only offered on Saturdays, Sundays and Public Holidays Accessing Support Services All Tickets must be investigated through the Customer’s internal support tiers prior to being referred to K3. Support Portal The Support Portal website address is https://support.k3btg.com. It is the best choice for Customers to access Support Services because it provides information which may solve the query automatically, and if not, it enables the Support Team to respond and help Customers more quickly due to the structured information about the Ticket which is captured via the Support Portal. In the unlikely event that a whole site is unable to trade (i.e. a Priority 1 Incident), then Customers can either phone the hotline, or raise a Ticket on the Support Portal. Any P1s raised by the portal are automatically notified to all support team members via an integration with K3’s internal chat platform (Microsoft Teams), so this method is just as fast as making a phone call, and may be the better method if you need to pass lots of information that is difficult to do over the phone (e.g. screenshots). Creating a Ticket via the Support Portal also facilitates efficient follow-up communications such as Support providing updates, and Customers providing further information if requested. Customers can self-register for the portal, and once we have performed verification checks, they will be able to see and do more than via email or phone (see You're here, but why use the portal?), and upon request, customers can see all tickets for their company as well as just their own. Support Hotline For Priority 1, 2, and 3 Incidents, and urgent Service Request - Questions, Premium SLA Customers may call the applicable local Support Hotline during Standard Hours (Priority 1 and 2 only during Extended Hours, if purchased). Lower priority Incidents, and non-Incidents (requests for help, change requests) must be registered via the Support Portal or email, not via the Hotline. Support may phone the Customer at a later point to explain something or discuss an issue if it’s likely to be the most efficient way to resolve an Incident. Type Contact Support Portal https://support.k3btg.com/ Support Email support@k3btg.com Danish & Swedish Support Hotline +45 7011 9100 Dutch Support Hotline +31 157 99 78 00 English Support Hotline (except for the below) +44 161 524 6793 English Support Hotline for SmartVision, Omnis, Sigma, JobBOSS +44 190 493 5732 German Support Hotline +49 7344 166 3100 Norwegian Support Hotline +47 3399 8150 Support Email The K3 Support email address is support@k3btg.com. Tickets raised by email default to a category of Service Request, and Priority 4, but once reviewed by a Support Team member, the Category, Impact, and Urgency will be updated in accordance with our understanding of the email content. Unlike tickets raised on the Support Portal which can be automatically prioritised and managed as applicable, this cannot happen automatically with tickets from email until they have been reviewed. Therefore, High Impact and Urgency Incidents should never be reported this way to avoid delays in the Incident being investigated. Ticket Communication Every Ticket raised will be assigned a unique reference number which is provided to the Customer on the Support Portal and via email to enable the Customer and K3 Support to follow up on Tickets efficiently where necessary. If the first contact from a Customer for a Priority 1 or Priority 2 Incident is via calling the Support Hotline, Support will register the details on the Support Portal to track details, notify the Customer of updates, and to maintain a full report of all Tickets raised by each Customer. Ticket updates, status, and target dates are available to view on the portal, and most updates are also emailed to the Customer. The Support Team may phone the Customer if it is determined to be the most efficient and effective way to provide an update or investigate an Incident further. K3’s Support Team will endeavour to communicate in the primary language of the Customer’s country, but to enable the maximum amount of K3’s expertise to be used to solve an Incident, K3’s Support Team may communicate in English even if the first contact was not in English. Service Management Quarterly Reviews Quarterly service reviews will be arranged with a K3 Support Manager and Customer Success Manager where the tickets raised in the previous period will be reviewed to assess where improvements may be made to the service, and where K3 might be able to help the customer to avoid similar issues in future. Bespoke reports will be made available to Customers in advance of the meeting which will provide a summary and detailed level of information, and can be tailored to the Customer’s needs. Escalation Process Priority 1 Incidents will be automatically escalated to a Support Manager who will ensure that all possible actions are taken to resolve it quickly. We are committed to delivering high quality support to all our Customers. In the unlikely event that a Customer has worked through K3’s support processes and is not satisfied with the service received, Customers can escalate the Support Ticket direct to a Support Manager via the portal, phone call, or email. Please provide the Ticket number and reason for the escalation. The escalation request will be evaluated by a Support Manager on a number of factors including the Ticket type and if the Ticket has not met any of the relevant target times in this SLA. Appendix: Definitions and Terms Please note the following terms and definitions that are used in this document. Term Definition Incident A type of Ticket which is a Product Fault causing an unplanned interruption to the Service or reduction in the quality of the Service. Product Fault Any error, bug, or defect with K3’s software, hardware, or hosting services (excluding any error, bug, or defect contained within any customer specific configuration or infrastructure). Support Services The provision by K3 of a remote support service to enable the Customer to report and K3 to investigate Product Faults in the applicable supported K3 product. Target Recovery Time The time from the Customer successfully registering an Incident with K3 Support to the time that K3 Support provides a Workaround which reduces the impact of an Incident. Target Resolution Time The time from the Customer successfully registering a Ticket with K3 Support to the time that K3 Support provides (i) a Workaround which K3 deems as a sufficient resolution that a permanent fix is not required, (ii) a permanent fix if no Workaround is possible, or if the Workaround cannot remain in place long-term. Target Response Time The time from the Customer successfully registering an Incident with K3 Support to the time that K3 Support first provides a (non-automated) response. Ticket A record of every request made by the Customer to K3 for Support Services. Workaround A temporary solution for an Incident to minimise the business impact while waiting for a permanent fix. As technology, products, and processes evolve, it may be necessary for K3 to amend, update, or supplement this guidance. This document may therefore be amended, updated, or supplemented from time to time by K3, at its discretion.",

Emails for follow-up on existing tickets are fine, regardless of the ticket category and priority. Phone Hotlines The support hotline is only for serious issues which prevent trading/operations. This keeps the phone lines free for emergencies only, so that if your business can't function, you are not waiting on the phone line while someone else is talking to Support about something less critical. To call support in an emergency (Priority 1 Incident) to report a new issue, please use the relevant number for your country below. Note that Premium SLA customers are also entitled to phone for Priority 2 Incidents. If our phone lines are busy, then please wait until you get through, or choose the option to leave a voicemail which you will be given if you have waited more than 5 minutes. If you log a P1 ticket via the Support Portal, then we will be alerted immediately, so this method is as effective as phoning the hotline, and may even be more effective if you need to provide screenshots or other information which we might ask you for on a phone call.

Standard Service Level Agreement (SLA) (must be logged into the customer portal to see this) What are the differences between the Standard and Premium SLA? Standard Hours We have support teams based in different countries who operate different standard hours in line with the majority of customer's standard open hours in that region.

Extended Hours Extended Hours are for customers who have subscribed to the extra support times and are for Priority 1 Incidents only (i.e. something which is preventing you from trading). Premium Service Level Agreement (SLA) customers can also contact Support for Priority 2 Incidents (e.g. something that is seriously restricting your ability to trade such as 1 POS not working, but 2 POS are working). Extended Hours are not available for some products (as noted below). You can register lower priority issues outside of our Standard Hours via the portal or email, but they will not be worked on during Extended Hours. Three Extended Hours options are available for additional fees to provide support for Priority 1 Incidents only as follows (either one or multiple options may be purchased): Weekday Evenings (excl. Public holidays) Saturdays Sundays and Public Holidays (excludes 25th December when we are closed, and some other exceptions) Please contact your K3 Customer Success Manager if you would like to purchase any of these options, or check if you have them already.

Standard Service Level Agreement (SLA) (must be logged into the customer portal to see this) What are the differences between the Standard and Premium SLA? Standard Hours We have support teams based in different countries who operate different standard hours in line with the majority of customer's standard open hours in that region. The Nordics Monday to Friday 8:30am to 4:30pm United Kingdom Monday to Friday 9:00am to 5:30pm except the below products: SmartVision, Omnis, Sigma, JobBOSS are supported Monday-Friday 9:00am to 5:00pm The Netherlands Monday to Friday 8:30am to 6:30pm Germany Monday to Friday 8:00am to 6:00pm Public Holidays on week days in the above regions are excluded; Extended Hours option 3 below is required to respond to customers on Public Holidays. Extended Hours Extended Hours are for customers who have subscribed to the extra support times and are for Priority 1 Incidents only (i.e. something which is preventing you from trading). Premium Service Level Agreement (SLA) customers can also contact Support for Priority 2 Incidents (e.g. something that is seriously restricting your ability to trade such as 1 POS not working, but 2 POS are working). Extended Hours are not available for some products (as noted below). You can register lower priority issues outside of our Standard Hours via the portal or email, but they will not be worked on during Extended Hours. Three Extended Hours options are available for additional fees to provide support for Priority 1 Incidents only as follows (either one or multiple options may be purchased): Weekday Evenings (excl. Public holidays) Saturdays Sundays and Public Holidays (excludes 25th December when we are closed, and some other exceptions) Please contact your K3 Customer Success Manager if you would like to purchase any of these options, or check if you have them already. The Nordics Weekday Evenings: 4:30pm to 7:00pm Saturdays: 10:00am to 6:00pm Sundays: 10:00am to 5:00pm and Public Holidays: 10:00am to 2:00pm United Kingdom Weekday Evenings: 5:30pm to 8:00pm Saturdays: 9:00am to 5:30pm Sundays and Public Holidays: 9:00am to 5:30pm No extended hours options for SmartVision, Omnis, Sigma, or JobBOSS. The Netherlands Thursday and Friday Evenings: 6:30pm to 9:30pm Saturdays: 8:30am to 5:30pm Sundays (no Public Holiday cover unless exceptionally agreed): 12:00pm to 5:30pm Germany No extended hours for Cowis. Imagine and DdD/RIAB have extended hours options which match The Nordics open hours. Holiday Period Exceptions Support is available on Public Holidays in the relevant country using Sunday open hours. There are some exceptions around major holidays such as Christmas and Easter which will be listed below if relevant. Christmas and New Year 2024/2025 The table below specifies the Support availability during this period (if the relevant Extended Hours option has been purchased).

    "text": "TABLE OF CONTENTS K3-Supplied Hardware in Year 1 If you have a K3 Hardware Support Contract If you do not have a K3 Hardware Support Contract (but K3 supplied the hardware) Post Year 1 Support (Hardware Support Contract Required) K3 Supplied Hardware Non-K3 Supplied Hardware When and How Will K3 Respond to Faults? Service Level Agreement Support Process What’s Not Covered K3-Supplied Hardware in Year 1 If you have a K3 Hardware Support Contract During the first year after K3 have supplied your POS/till, the full system is covered which includes: All-in-one POS units or PC based units Receipt printers Barcode scanners Cash drawers Monitors (if sold with PC base unit) Optional Add-ons you may have purchased: Ticket printers Label printers Tablets Standalone monitors/screens Hand Held Terminals (HHT’s) K3 Supplied Integrated Payment Terminals (purchased with an additional EFT package) Cover is for: Hardware Failures - Malfunctioning or failed items supplied by K3. Diagnosis and repair - Faults that occur through normal usage of the equipment. POS OS - POS Windows operating system issues which cause the POS to cease working. Associated Cable or PSU Failures - Issues with power supply units (PSUs) or data cables originally supplied with covered items. Remote or On-Site Attendance as required for repair or replacement of faulty hardware. Depending on the criticality, we may ask you to ship items to us for repair. If you do not have a K3 Hardware Support Contract (but K3 supplied the hardware) If you do not have a K3 hardware support contract, you will be covered under the manufacturer's warranty only. Items will be handled via the suppliers standard RTB (return to base) warranty policy which K3 will facilitate. Note that our assistance will not be governed by a Service Level Agreement. Any shipping or initial inspection costs incurred by K3 will be passed on to the customer. The manufacturer's warranty may be longer than one year, but if you do not have a support contract with us, you will need to work with the manufacturer direct (or ask for us to quote to help you). Post Year 1 Support (Hardware Support Contract Required) K3 Supplied Hardware For K3-supplied hardware, customers can opt to purchase an annual hardware support contract (if they haven't already from the date we supplied the hardware). If a spare part is required for a repair, and it's for standard hardware which K3 supplied, the cost of the spare part is included in the annual hardware support. We generally hold them in stock for quick remediation which includes new and refurbished parts. In the unlikely event that a whole replacement POS unit or other sealed unit such as a tablet is required (not just a spare part), then this would not be included free of charge (unless the manufacturer's warranty provides for a free new complete unit). Note that if K3 supplied the hardware which is now more than a year old, but you do not have a hardware support contract with K3, then we may be able to help you, but it would not be governed by any SLA target times, and all time and materials would be chargeable at the standard rates. Non-K3 Supplied Hardware We can provide hardware support via a contract for customers who did not purchase their hardware from us. We will carry out a hardware audit before quoting and taking on support which will include recommendations, and terms bespoke for each customer. We will not purchase spares for your own hardware, but you may purchase spares which we will hold in stock, ready for any emergency repairs. Also See - How Long Can Hardware be Supported For? - Need Help, but Don't have a Hardware Support Contract? When and How Will K3 Respond to Faults? The following only applies to customers who have a hardware support contract in place. Service Level Agreement Customers with an annual hardware support contract will benefit from the target times as explained in the Standard Service Level Agreement (SLA). This SLA applies to the hardware and any faults with K3 software which you may be subscribing to. We will fix things remotely if possible, but if required to attend a site, we pride ourselves on usually being able to attend either the same, or next business day (depending on location and time of the fault being raised to us). Standard Hours of coverage are weekdays (excluding UK Public Holidays) by default, but there are options to purchase weekend and Public Holiday cover as well, as explained in What days and times is Support available? In addition, there is an option for having a Premium Service Level Agreement (SLA) - see What are the Benefits of the Premium SLA? for more information. Support Process We have multiple channels for you to gain access to support - see How do I contact K3 Retail Support? Once a support ticket is identified as a hardware-related issue, our first line support team will pass it to the hardware support team. Once the hardware technician confirms that the customer and hardware is eligible for hardware support, the technician will performs an initial diagnosis of the problem through a phone call or remote session. Basic checks include: POS units - Is there power to the unit? Can it reboot? Are any error messages displayed on the screen? Receipt printers - Can it print a self-test with legible text? Barcode scanners - Can it scan a barcode in Notepad? Cash drawers - Does it open correctly? If necessary, the technician will arrange an on-site visit at a mutually convenient time to investigate and rectify the issue. For issues which don't require a specialist engineer on site, we may ship replacement items to you and provide you with instructions and remote assistance to install them. What’s Not Covered Regardless of how old the hardware is, the following are not included in the hardware purchase price or support fees: Deliberate or Accidental Damage - Hardware damage caused intentionally or due to mishandling or accidents. This includes cosmetic damage which is not covered. Environmental Changes - Damage resulting from environmental factors such as water, heat, electrical, or other external conditions outside of our control. 3rd Party Changes - Any modifications, non-approved software installations, changes to the operating system or amendments by the customer, third-party services or vendors. 3rd Party Software - Any software not owned by K3 (e.g. the Windows operating system, antivirus), and updates to 3rd party software. Item Relocation - Moving or relocating hardware to a different location without consulting with K3 or K3's involvement. Consumables like printer toner, print heads, accessories, parts intended by the equipment manufacturer to require periodic replacement. Additional Hardware – Hardware not supplied by K3, or if you are using your own hardware, if it was not in the support contract audit. Data Restoration - if data is lost as a result of a hardware failure (e.g. a hard drive), we will rebuild the software, but cannot recover the software's data. If you have a backup and need help restoring it, we may be able to assist (time would be chargeable) Items Beyond Economic Repair - Any hardware where the cost of the required part(s) to make the hardware properly functional will exceed the current list or new replacement price, and/or any required spare parts or components are no longer available from the manufacturer.",

    "text": "Peace of Mind for Five Years or More With an annual hardware support contract from K3, you have the peace of mind of knowing that any faults included in the agreement will be supported until the hardware is five years old. Once the hardware is more than five years old, we may still be able to offer support, but the cost of available spare parts would not be included. To provide lightening fast support, we hold spare parts for standard K3-supplied hardware, and we can also hold spare parts that customers purchase and ask us to manage for them. The availability of spare parts is one of the factors which limit the support of hardware to five years, but occasionally suppliers will end support and availability early, in which case we will advise you if spare parts are no longer available, even if your hardware is less than five years old. Recycling Hardware When equipment is surplus to requirements or at the end of its “usable” life, it can be donated or recycled. For a minimal fee, we can handle this for you. You may want to shred hard drives to be certain that data is secure which is a service we can also provide. What if You Don't have a Hardware Support Contract with K3? If you purchased the hardware from us, the manufacturer's warranty will apply - please see If you do not have a K3 Hardware Support Contract (but K3 supplied the hardware) for more information, or see Need Help, but Don't have a Hardware Support Contract?",

    "text": "TABLE OF CONTENTS Introduction Windows 10 IoT Enterprise LTSC Windows 7 Pro and Embedded POSReady 7 Windows XP Windows 8 and 8.1 End of Life Windows versions Introduction This article refers to the Windows version running on your Point Of Sale / Till. These versions are usually different to the ones running on a normal desktop PC / Laptop. For more information on what's supported for non-POS K3 software, please search this knowledgebase (e.g. What Operating Systems is the MStore Back Office Supported On?) Windows 10 IoT Enterprise LTSC Microsoft Windows 10 LTSC has several versions but most customers will be running either 2019 or 2021 2019 has an extended end of life date of 9th Jan 2029, version 2021 has an extended end of life date of 13th Jane 2032 so if you are running one of these versions you do not need to take any immediate action. If you have provided your own POS, it might be running on Microsoft Windows 10 Home or Pro which are usually found on desktop PCs and laptops, and will reach their end of life support on 14th October 2025 https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/products/windows-10-home-and-pro If you believe your system is running a Win 10 Pro or Home edition please contact your internal IT department and reach out to your CSM team member at K3 to discuss upgrade options. Windows 7 Pro and Embedded POSReady 7 Microsoft Windows 7 extended end of life support ended on 14th Jan 2020 Microsoft Windows Embedded POSReady 7 extended end of life ended on 12th October 2021 What to do next - if you believe your system is still running one of these versions please contact your internal IT Department and reach out to your CSM team member at K3 to discuss upgrade options Windows XP Microsoft Windows XP extended end of life support ended on 8th April 2014 What to do next - if you believe your system is still running one of these versions please contact your internal IT Department and reach out to your CSM team member at K3 to discuss upgrade options Windows 8 and 8.1 Microsoft Windows 8 and 8.1 extended end of life support ended on 12th Jan 2016 and 10th Jan 2023 respectively. What to do next - if you believe your system is still running one of these versions please contact your internal IT Department and reach out to your CSM team member at K3 to discuss upgrade options End of Life Windows versions A recent review has highlighted that a large proportion of customers are still using outdated operating systems (Windows XP, Windows 7, and Windows 7 Embedded) on their POS units which poses significant security risks and operational challenges to their businesses. Here are some key points and recommendations: Security Risks Outdated operating systems, such as Windows XP and Windows 7, no longer receive critical security updates from Microsoft. This makes POS units running these systems vulnerable to malware, hackers, and ransomware attacks. The lack of security updates increases the likelihood of data breaches and compromises sensitive customer information breaking GDPR policy. Be aware of the risks associated with using unsupported operating systems and the importance of keeping both hardware and software up to date to avoid potential security threats and the financial impact of data breaches. Hardware Issues Older POS units are likely to experience more hardware issues, reduced reliability, and slower performance compared to newer units. Upgrading to modern POS hardware with the latest operating system can improve system reliability, speed, and overall performance. Recommendations Upgrade POS operating systems to a more secure and supported operating system will ensure that you receive regular security updates to protect against emerging threats. Older hardware may not be powerful enough to have an OS upgrade. Upgrade hardware to newer POS models that are compatible with modern operating systems. Newer hardware is more reliable, faster, and better equipped to handle the demands of modern point-of-sale. Implement security best practices, in the short term, while upgrading is being planned, ensure you are following security best practices. This may include using our antivirus software, regularly backing up data, and implementing network security measures. Timeline for Upgrades Discuss and plan a timeline for upgrading your POS systems with your CSM. By addressing these issues and implementing a proactive approach to system upgrades, you can help mitigate security risks, enhance system performance, and ensure the business continuity and long-term sustainability of your POS units.",
