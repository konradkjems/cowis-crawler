First step Click none to clear all and select the store you want to perform this for. Although multiple stores can be chosen on this worksheet, it is highly recommended doing them one at a time. 1. To avoid confusion 2. The second step explained later will be better served doing one at a time. Click Next You will see the following dialogue box. Ordinarily you can leave this as is and click next. Click Finish Check the details and click Approve. A worksheet will be created. Wait for the store to poll and process the worksheet, (Green flag). Once processed, no changes have been made. It has merely uploaded store quantities to the HQ but not made any changes to the inventory. The next step will allow the changes to be made. This is why it is advisable to do one store at a time. The next step needs to be performed before the store polls again. This is because the worksheet has uploaded quantities as they are now. Once the store polls again, any sales, returns or transfers will not be represented in the uploaded quantities. If you miss this window, the worksheet will need to be run again. Second step As stated earlier, the above worksheet must have been processed by the store. This step MUST be performed before the store polls again, unless they are currently not trading. Otherwise the quantities uploaded via the worksheet may no longer be correct, due to sales, returns or other inventory changes. HQ needs to be in maintenance mode. Go to wizards and select inventory wizard. Click Next Select task 190: Full item count reconciliation. Click Next Select the store you did the 501 worksheet for. You can check the box ( only show discrepancies). I have left it blank as there are no discrepancies on my test data. Click Next. Click Finish. A box will be displayed showing the discrepancies between the HQ and the uploaded store quantities. . Once you click commit HQ quantities will be changes to match the uploaded store quantities. It is not a bad idea to perform this periodically to make sure the data is correct.",

The 402 (data upload) worksheet runs every time the store connects and processes sales, transfers as well as other data. If Polling has stalled you will notice that no sales data for the affected stores appear in reports. The first thing to check is that HQ server and Voucher server (if used) are both running and waiting for connection (green arrow). Next check that the worksheets are being processed. In H! manager Go To View / Worksheet status / Store status (as shown below). Flag symbols are as follows. White - unapproved, Green - completed, Blue - not completed but not due yet, Blue with yellow ! - Not processed but overdue. The Blue ones with an ! will be the ones that have not polled. The last polled date is shown. First try restarting HQ server by clicking file / exit on both HQ server and Voucher server. Or by ending HQserver.exe in Task Manager, NB (Voucher server is also HQserver.exe in TM). IMPORTANT!! HQ server must be started first, if voucher server is started first HQserver will return an error when starting and won't start. After restarting HQ and Voucher server and Voucher server check the status of worksheets again as above. If still not polling check HQclient in the stores is running and processing worksheets. In the stores HQclient will be running either on a Back Office PC or Till 1. HQ client looks like this. Check that worksheets 'completed with no errors'. Voucher server looks slightly different and doesn't process worksheets as such but facilitates global vouchers. When all completed and working Worksheet status looks like this.",

    "text": "When an RMS till goes into offline mode, the current batch is Blind Closed by the system. If the till is used in offline mode the these transactions go into a separate batch in the offline database. When the till is back online (reconnected to the primary database), this batch too is uploaded to the server and blind closed. The transaction from that point forward go into a new (3rd) batch and trading continues as normal. When you come to Z read at the end of the day only the transactions from the point the database was reconnected will show (3rd batch). In order to balance the till, it will be necessary to X and Z read these blind closed batches. To do this follow the following instructions. First of all exit POS, this is because POS holds the printer and the X and Z reads will not print if the printer is help on to by POS. Open SO manager. Go to Journal / Update batch info. Click OK on the dialogue box that appears, there is no need to enter any filters. Find Blind Closed batches in the list. The below image only shows open batches as I do not have any blind closed batches currently. Open batches are current batches being worked, these can not be X or Z read here. To process the batches Double click on the batch number. This will bring up the options below. Whether you need to enter Opening and Closing amounts depends on your current settings. When you have Z read all of the batches for the day in question. These Z reads can be added to the totals from the main Z read to balance the till. Please remember that if POS is still open and you process the Z read, the Z read will not print but it will process the bacth and it will no longer be available in this list. There is nothing we can do to get it back, so please make sure POS is exited before this process is undertaken.",

It’s easily found by searching for “RMSify” at http://apps.shopify.com The software itself is a single installer which can be used anywhere in the RMS estate. There are no different installers for Headquarters, Store or POS as there are with other integrated solutions. It’s one simple package which can be installed wherever you need to run it. The package consists of 2 components. RMSify Sync – This is the application which synchronises your product data between RMS and Shopify, and is also where all settings are configured. RMSify Sync can either synchronise data from RMS to Shopify, or the other way round – from Shopify into RMS. This can be run on a Store Operations database or a Headquarters database and it will automatically detect which it is and behave accordingly. This is usually operated from a “Back office” computer. RMSify Web Orders – This is the application which runs on the till and allows the process of Shopify Web Orders through the RMS POS interface. It retrieves outstanding orders from Shopify to allow a “Picking List” to be printed to your receipt printer. Once picked, it imports the order as a standard POS transaction and allows you to tender the transaction as per RMS. It then notifies Shopify that the order has been shipped. It can only be launched through a Custom POS Button and therefore can only be run on an RMS Point of Sale. As already discussed, RMSify can be used in Store Operations and Headquarters, or a combination of both. Here are the supported topologies which you can deploy RMSify to. Standard Headquarters – This scenario is when product data is synchronising from the Headquarters database. All web orders must be processed through an RMS POS, and you must choose which store is going to be used to process your web orders. You can optionally choose which “on hand” figures you want to use in Shopify – Either the quantities from the store you selected as your web store or the total of “on hand” quantities from all of your stores. In this scenario, it is not possible to run Sync and Web Orders on the same physical computer. Store Only Headquarters – This scenario is when your store is part of an RMS Headquarters chain, but product data and web orders are all processed through a single store as part of that chain. This is not recommended, as any product data amended at store level is liable to be overwritten by an RMS Headquarters Worksheet. In this scenario, only local store inventory data is used for your Shopify inventory levels. Single Store – This scenario is when you have only one RMS store. Both RMSify Sync and RMSify Web Orders run from the single store database.",

When an order meets the set criteria (i.e. Fulfilled/Paid) RMSify will automatically create a corresponding transaction in your RMS database for the Web Order. This setting gives you the flexibility of allowing you to fulfil your orders through the Shopify admin panel but still track and amend stock in your RMS system to ensure inventory levels are as accurate as possible. This setting can be enabled in the RMSify Sync Settings under the rules tab and enabling \"Automatically Create RMS Transactions\": Once enabled, you'll need to decide when you want RMSify to create the transactions by setting the \"Create Transactions When\" option: When set to Fulfilled, RMSify will automatically create a transaction in RMS as soon as you mark the order as fulfilled in Shopify. RMSify will still commit stock on orders that haven't yet been fulfilled and committed stock will be released when the transaction is created in RMS. When set to Paid, RMSify will automatically create a transaction in RMS as soon as the order in Shopify is marked as Paid. Stock will typically not be committed in this instance as orders will typically come through as 'Paid' immediately. This means that the transaction will be created almost instantly and instead of being set to committed, the stock will be removed from your on-hand quantities You'll also need to select your preferred cashier to be assigned to the transactions in RMS. This drop-down will list all cashiers listed in your RMS database. Finally, you can specify a register for the transactions to be created against. Web Order Transactions will be posted into the currently open batch on the specified register. When enabling this setting in a HQ environment, RMSify will automatically create #51 Worksheets to update your nominated Web Stores settings. You'll need to ensure these worksheets are processed to ensure Auto Transactions is enabled at the Store level. Like Transactions, you also have the option of automatically creating returns. Auto returns will identify any orders that have been refunded or partially refunded and process a corresponding return in RMS. Important note: When this setting is enabled, the stock for any refunds will be sent back to your on-hand quantities. If you aren't receiving the stock back you'll need to ensure to manually adjust the stock accordingly. Auto Transactions can be enabled without Auto Refunds but Auto Refunds CANNOT be enabled without Auto Transactions. If you wish to create automatic refunds RMSify will also create automatic transactions.",

    "text": "Sometimes you may be required to set a custom running time for your RMSify Automatic Stock Updates. Since the function of the stock sync is to update Shopify with stock sold in your brick and mortar store it is best practice to run your Stock Updates during trading hours only or if in a HQ environment, only for the duration that your Stock Source stores are polling. By default RMSify only allows you to pick from certain timing options for your schedule: You can change the timings more granularly by editing the Scheduled Task itself in Windows Task Scheduler. To do this: Open Windows Task Scheduler. Find your RMSify Stock sync (this should be called \"RMSify_StockUpdate\") and double-click into it to open the proerties. Navigate to the 'Triggers' tab and edit the current trigger: Set your start time to be your opening time: Enable the 'Repeat Task every:' option and set the frequency to your desired amount: When selecting a duration you'll notice the drop-down only includes set amounts. You can add any duration you wish by simply typing into the text field. It may be tempting to run the schedule as frequently as possible. However, this can actually be detrimental. Best practice when choosing a frequency when running in an RMS HQ environment is to match your 401 worksheet frequency. This ensures HQ has the latest stock figures and isn't updating Shopify unnecessarily. Another consideration is the amount of items included in the stock sync. Typically we would recommend not running your stock sync more frequently than 1 hour. In the below example our trading hours would be 09:00 - 18:00 and the stock sync will run on the hour, every hour between those times: Click 'OK' on all open windows to save your changes.",

Whilst data syncing is in progress, you will see a progress bar for each section of the sync that it has to perform. Each of these are detailed later in the user guide. Log The log section of the screen shows you useful information about the sync process, allowing you to see exactly what is happening during data synchronisation. If you double click an error in the log, it will show you the full details of the error, which can often be much more helpful when deducing the cause of the issue or warning. If you need to send these log files to K3 for analysis, then use the Help > Send Logs menu. Sync Section This area lists the different Shopify fields which RMS can sync with. These make use of the field mappings which are defined in the configuration. At any time you can see what field is mapped to it by hovering the pointer over the field name. To Shopify This column allows you to pick which fields you want to update in Shopify when you press the Sync button. It will only update fields in Shopify which have a check in the box. Cells which are shaded out are “required” fields that you can not toggle, so will always synchronise with Shopify. From Shopify This column allows you to synchronise data back from Shopify into RMS when you press the sync button. It is designed so that you can make the most of Shopify’s WYSIWYG editor and apply rich formatting to your product description and product pages. Cells which are shaded out are “required” fields that you can not toggle, so will always synchronise with Shopify. Sync Buttons When one of the relevant Sync buttons is pressed, data will be syncronised between RMS and Shopify in the direction that you choose. Only fields which have a check in the box will be synchronised. They will only synchronise new or changed data. Go To Webstore This button takes you directly to the administration area of your Shopify web store. You will still need to log in using your registered username and password. If you are using the Multiple Web Stores feature, the button will take you to the administration page of the webstore selected in the Sync drop down box. Choose Web Store If you are using the Multiple Web Stores feature, then the Sync screen has a drop down box listing the web stores you have configured. Pressing the Sync button will sync data for the web store selected in this box only.",

Additionally, once Web Orders has been opened the first time in the day, it will check for Web Orders automatically for you in the background, every 5 minutes. If it finds an order, it will tell you. If you restart your computer, you will need to click the Web Orders button again the first time to restart the automatic web order download process again. If you are using the Multiple Web Stores feature, pressing this button will retrieve orders from all web stores which this store has been configured to process orders for. For more information, please see section 4.9. Apply Date Range By default when you open Web Orders the Apply date Range option is unchecked and will download the 20 latest orders from your web store. Pressing More Web orders will then download the next 20 open orders from Shopify. Using the Apply Date Range option you can grab the open orders for a specific date. This will use the From Date and To Date to determine what to download and will grab any order created between 00:00 on the From Date up to 23:59 on the To Date. To Apply a Date Range check the Apply Date Range checkbox and enter the dates followed by pressing ‘Get Web Orders’. This will refresh the web orders list to show any open orders between these dates. Please note the date range settings are saved so when you exit Web Orders and reopen it will apply the previously set date range, if on the next open you want it to grab All open orders ensure before closing the Web Orders box you uncheck the Apply Date Range option.",
